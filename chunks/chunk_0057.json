It pretended to describe a possible governance even if it was a parody with no intention of reducing the issues of governance to algorithms. However, it blurred the difference between metaphors and algorithms, historical processes, and abstractions, and the experience of Kairos with the search for Chronos. This distortion redefined how we think about governance with respect to the technology, leading to present promises of a trustless society optimized over blockchain technology and self-learning AIs. Lamport\u2019s 1970s algorithms for distributed networks facing faulty, unreliable, and even malicious nodes thus played an essential role in modern computing and also in algorithmic governance.\",\n      \"summary\": \"The Paxos and Byzantine generals allegories were complex metaphors in computing that unintentionally blurred the lines between metaphors and algorithms, changing how we perceive governance in relation to technology. This resulted in the concept of a trustless society powered by blockchain and AI.

He then gave lectures dressed as an Indiana Jones archaeologist searching for a new algorithm: \u2018My attempt at inserting some humor into the subject was a dismal failure.\",\n      \"summary\": \"Despite his attempts to popularize the Paxos algorithm with the use of metaphors and humor, Lamport's efforts were unsuccessful.
