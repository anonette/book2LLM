On the one hand, they support the open-ended exploration and flourishing of human agency. On the other hand, they promise innovation as control over the future and governance. Examples of ancient clocks, Renaissance visions of scientific instruments that bring light (experimenta lucifera), or infrastructures for automation close the future to predetermined goals of progress and theological restoration. As Renaissance cosmoscopes, living instruments, and examples of the folly of empiricism, including present open science hardware, prototypes open the future to human agency and action with no guarantees. Unlike the teleological expectations of progress and restoration, forgotten and marginal prototyping practices imagine radical transformation on multiple micro, meso and macro levels.  \",\n      \"summary\": \"Prototypes serve as mediators in society, accommodating various viewpoints towards the future, and facilitating open-ended exploration.

Such open-ended, forgotten, and marginal Renaissance projects, including the tinkering of modern artisans, hackers, geeks, and makers define prototyping as a matter of participation and empowerment. Instead of supporting the myth and ideal of automation in governance represented by the figures of the Leviathan and Wicker Man, such prototyping is an opportunity for agency, vision, and experiments beyond any universal solution and absolute rule. In this sense, prototyping defines a need for democratizing future-making and realizing that time is Kairos, a public resource and infrastructure for commons preserving the opportunity for our agency. \",\n      \"summary\": \"Community-driven and DIY instruments contribute to the revival of artisan and natural philosophers' practices, placing an emphasis on participation and empowerment.
