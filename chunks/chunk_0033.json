When we compare the Renaissance artisan instruments and present OSH to the more classic examples of the vacuum airpump (Baudot, 2012; van Helden, 1991), we can notice the difference. The purpose of the DIY instruments is not to woo the public into worship of science but to invite everyone to take part in the tinkering and demystify the aura of science and technology. In this respect, OSH explores the idea of the artisanal origins of modern science and society described by the historian and philosopher of science, Edgar Zilsel. His forgotten 1942 thesis describes the work of superior artisans in the Renaissance period as a practice that bridged the social, epistemic, and political divides crucial for any social transformation.\"],\n\"summary\": \"The DIY science instruments not only explore the forces in nature but also the role of citizen scientists and hackers who use them in unexpected ways.
