We will discuss the convergence between ontology, cosmology, and politics that led to the ideal of automated governance and to the emergence of governance machines. While previous sections have described how sundials introduced control over the private lives and metabolism of citizens as parasites, the next chapter will focus on the water clock (clepsydra) and the theme of universal slavery. The clepsydra expanded the time control from private life to public institutions, further weakening citizens' power over their future and time.\",\n            \"summary\": \"This paragraph discusses how the control of time, termed as Chronos, enables automated governance leading to a loss of agency for citizens. It explains that the introduction of time-keeping instruments like sundials and the water clock has given rise to this phenomenon, with the latter expanding time control to public institutions.\",\n            \"questions\": [\n                \"What does Chronos represent in the context of governance?\",\n                \"How did sundials influence the control over citizens' private life?\",\n                \"What role did the water clock play in expanding the control of time?\"\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"content\": \"To prevent the rule of the governance machine and Chronos, we must capture the genealogy of this resignation upon agency and the possibility of personal and social action (described as Kairos in governance as well as in technology in the next chapters). The ontological and cosmological search for cycles in nature and patterns in data prepared the stage for the pervasive control of society by Chronos, data and algorithms. After discussing the persistence of the myth of automation and the rule of governance machines (Sections 2.1 and 2.2), we will look at forgotten examples of instruments that introduce the idea of prototypes in governance beyond \u2018advantageous\u2019 monopolies and Chronos. We will use examples of Renaissance instruments (Sections 2.3 and 2.4) and later open-science hardware (Chapter 3), to capture alternatives to the pervasive control over the machines of governance. As an experimental practice that connects questions of technology and governance, prototyping in the service of Kairos will define a model of experimental governance of technological futures in the exploratory sandboxes in Chapter 4.\",\n            \"summary\": \"The paragraph suggests that in order to prevent complete control by the automated governance machine and Chronos, it's necessary to understand the historical resignation of agency.
