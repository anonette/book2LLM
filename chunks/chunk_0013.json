While this answered the question of when this change occurred, it remains unclear why we have reduced decision-making and agency to the inevitable but arbitrarily constructed Chronos? Why has politics become a matter of cycles, patterns, models, and data? The belief in structures superior to human agency is part of an old belief in rituals that leads directly to current fantasies of incorruptible algorithmic governance: \u2018For the evangelist, blockchain is not only a tool that facilitates decision-making processes but comes to stand in for the political process itself. This is 'governance by design\u2019, where cryptographic protocols not only have politics, but are politics in the age of algorithmic governance\u2019 (O\u2019Dwyer, n.d.) As Rachel O'Dwyer noted in her work on blockchain governmentality (Ibid.), the idea of certainty of the algorithms and data patterns promotes the ideal of political control.\",\n      \"summary\": \"The transformation of tools into governance mechanisms can be traced back to ancient ritual practices and timekeepers, leading to modern attempts to 'code' governance.

The reduction of the social and individual experience of time (Kairos) to cosmology and ontology (Chronos) preserves the status quo of the various patrons with their clocks and tables. Whereas the history of the sundial and clepsydra captures the moments when instruments become governance machines, there is also a forgotten history of instrument making as a practice that preserves time as Kairos in personal and public matters.\",\n      \"summary\": \"Anecdotes about ancient instruments hint at the risks of automated systems, namely precarity, false scarcity, and loss of agency.

Thales\u2019 contraption and knowledge of Chronos enabled algorithmic rule, but they also emphasized the gap between theory and practice, or insight (into holon or Chronos) and action (Kairos), technology, and governance. Time as insight into Chronos and experience of Kairos in Thales leads to the monopolies and predictions, but also remains an opportunity to fall, fail, and reconsider the values of society. The same knowledge and data that produced the monopoly over olive presses supported Thales\u2019 critique of the society. While Aristotle admired Thales' prediction that controls the future, Plato warned us against such power that reduces the future to existing prejudices in society (wealth and ancestry). Plato's passages on Thales in Theaetetus introduced the idea of future as a matter of governance and lawmaking that preserve agency and the experience of time as Kairos. Plato defines governance as a search for an authentic experience of time, future, and agency closer to banquets with peers or composing new music rather than monopolizing existing political and economic power or asserting absolute control.\",\n      \"summary\": \"Renaissance artisans adopted the critical aspects of Thales' project, which highlighted the disconnect between theory and practice in governance.

It promises omnipotence, but hides the caveat about the future, the need to sacrifice our \u2018firstborns\u2019, or, more generally, the ability to act and define the future. Legends about devil bridges always include a human sacrifice that metaphorically depicts the loss of agency. Enchanted by the new infrastructure, we surrender our personal autonomy to automation.
