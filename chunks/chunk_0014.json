From clepsydra and sundials to blockchain technologies, all algorithms, patterns, and cycles create predictable and profitable futures for the few while foreclosing the opportunities for the many. Instead of enabling citizens to negotiate agonistic interests and futures, algorithms lead to a resignation upon shared future(s). Chronos outsources decision making and deliberation to blockchain consensus mechanisms, machine learning algorithms, and other magical infrastructures, depriving everyone of agency. It generates parasites dependent on new infrastructure, sacrificing their agency and open future for the ideals of progress or restoration (Instauratio in the next chapter).\"], \n \"summary\": \"The author expresses concern over the use of algorithms in politics. They argue that algorithms limit opportunities for many while profiting a few. The automated decision-making processes deprive people of agency and create dependency on new infrastructures.\", \n \"questions\": [\"What are the dangers of using algorithms in politics?\", \"How do algorithms limit opportunities for many?\", \"How are people deprived of their agency through automated decision-making processes?\"]},\n\n{\"title\": \"The governance machines and their effects\", \n \"paragraphs\": [\"Governance machines bring automated biases, hidden slavery, mechanical injustice, and time control by new patrons and innovators. Instead of reconciling the ontology and cosmology of Chronos with politics and governance serving Kairos (discussed as a dichotomy of structure and action, or timekeeping and timing), the instruments impose one future that will rule all. To resist control of time and the future, we emphasize the acts of \u2018creating\u2019, designing, and making decisions about technology as much as governance. Instead of becoming parasites, we should strive to be Plato connoisseurs and artists who indulge in the uniqueness of their experience rather than promises of universal control. Instead of excessive control and automation, the prototypes that we will describe in the next sections and Chapter 3 support the efforts to create a shared public future.\"], \n \"summary\": \"The author highlights how governance machines may automate biases and control time, imposing a singular future. They urge for a focus on creation, design, and decision-making in technology and governance to resist this control.

Chronos provides insights into patterns and phenomena that transcend human life and society and impose them as an ideal of governance as automation. The anecdotes about Thales in Aristotle and Plato capture the origins of this admiration of prediction and control of the future. In Aristotle, Thales predicted the future based on observable cycles and patterns in nature to perform the philosopher's ability to use time for creative endeavors and research. In Plato, Thales uses the same insight into the cosmos to openly reject the status quo in society, dominated by the values of wealth and lineage.\"], \n \"summary\": \"The author argues that the reduction of politics to cosmology and ontology, based on the concept of time as Chronos, hides the importance of time as Kairos.

It expresses a tension between natural systems and political projects, between langue and parole, or structure and action. Initially, the two concepts of time were interchangeable, so Kairos meant right timing but also \u2018due measure\u2019 or \u2018proper proportion\u2019 referring to the immutable laws of the universe, such as the seasons in Hesiod's works or the days and numbers in Pythagoras (Sipiora & Baumlin, 2002). As an opportune moment to act, express vulnerability, or even mortality (e.g., in the Iliad), Kairos gradually contrasted with Chronos, which became an external structure that describes ontology or cosmology (Ibid.). Kairos became a matter of context, chance, action, and we also claim agency as the ability to transform, challenge, disobey, explore, and experiment.\"], \n \"summary\": \"The author discusses the complex dichotomy of Chronos and Kairos, which reflects the tension between natural systems and political projects.

They blamed instruments for introducing a nonhuman perspective and scale of planets and atoms into human affairs that relativize the personal and social struggles on the planet or in society. Automation through instruments and infrastructures further exacerbated the problem with outsourcing politics to an ontology and cosmology ignorant of the \u2018being\u2019 (Pato\u010dka, 1996) or actions that change history and politics (Arendt, 2013).\"], \n \"summary\": \"The author refers to various philosophers who criticized science for undermining public life and politics by introducing a nonhuman perspective.
