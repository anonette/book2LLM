Bacon rejects the experimenta fructifera, the wild, poetic, and often creative experiments and visions of society that question the ideal of the predefined and closed future. Making prototypes without pre-given, political, and religious visions of an institution that serves the patrons who represent God's order on earth is irresponsible in Bacon\u2019s view. He wants to avoid any uncertainty about whose interest science, technology, and the new institution serve. He explicitly names the institution of science after the mythical King Salomon to signal the conservative agenda of preserving the teleological (and monarchist) goals of science and technology as tools restoring religion, myth, and rituals.\", \n\"summary\": \"Bacon criticizes the experimenta fructifera as they are not aligned with the theological and political goals of his proposed institution, Solomon's house. He seeks to establish science and technology as tools for restoring religion and preserving political status quo.\", \n\"questions\": [\"What does Bacon propose as the purpose of Solomon\u2019s house?\", \"What elements of experimenta fructifera does Bacon reject and why?\", \"How does Bacon's view on science and technology align with religious and political ideologies?\"]},\n\n{\"title\": \"Science, technology and governance in post-Bacon era\",\n\"paragraph\": \"Science and technology since Bacon follow this conservative, social and political agenda of the religious and teleological project of Instauratio. In the later period, the restoration is rebranded into the enlightenment ideal of progress or technocratic ideal of governance driven by experts.  The teleology of God's plan with humanity informs all later concepts of governance as a problem of automation and algorithmic rule of some ideal pre-given order that science and technology both discover and re-enact. The closing of the future to the idealized notions of society mirroring an ontological or cosmological certainties or orders reduces the issues of governance to Chronos and closes the future for the parasites.\",\n\"summary\": \"Post-Bacon, science and technology follow a conservative, religious, and political agenda. This is seen in the governance concepts that focus on automation and algorithmic rule aligned with a predefined ideal order, closing off the future to certain societal groups.\",\n\"questions\": [\"How has the approach to science and technology changed since Bacon?\", \"What ideals did later concepts of governance embrace?\", \"How does this approach to science and technology impact the future?\"]},\n\n{\"title\": \"Experimenta fructifera and living trees with living fruit\",\n\"paragraph\": \"The prototyping and instrument making since the Renaissance period combines metaphysical, religious, and social aspirations that serve different ideas about the future. Philosophers and artisans, such as Cornelius Drebbel, Jakob Bornitz, or Robert Fludd, used prototypes to mimic the generative and unpredictable properties of nature (Kairos) and explore new values in society. They believed that they could transform the world, society, and even the body of the artisan with their work on instruments serving various political and social projects. The prototyping made cosmology and ontology (as expressions of Chronos) part of personal and political projects, a matter of Kairos and open future. The biblical fall like Thales\u2019 fall before became an opportunity for a critique of the existing status quo (Section 2.1) that leads to transformation rather than restoration. In contrast, the fall in Bacon is a metaphor for degradation that the teleological and theological Instauratio claims to repair.\",\n\"summary\": \"During the Renaissance, prototyping and instrument-making combined varied aspirations and served different future ideas. Philosophers and artisans used prototypes to imitate nature's unpredictability and explore societal values. This process incorporated cosmology and ontology into personal and political projects.\",\n\"questions\": [\"How did philosophers and artisans during the Renaissance use prototypes?\", \"What was the role of prototyping in personal and political projects?\", \"How did these Renaissance thinkers differentiate their approach from Bacon's?\"]},\n\n{\"title\": \"Future between restoration and transformation\",\n\"paragraph\": \"The prototypes and informal networks or scientists and artisans formed over the travelogues and personal inscriptions in the books of friends (album amicorum) also remind us of the present hackerspaces.  Alchemists, artisans, and philosophers in the 17th century captured an unsystematic but open and experimental knowledge that contrasts with Bacon's institutionalized science and teleological goals of Instauratio. Instead of supporting any political status quo that mirrors the ideal state before the fall, or reducing the social progress to technological and scientific advancements, their artisan prototypes emphasize time as Kairos that enables tinkering and networking.\",\n\"summary\": \"Prototypes and informal networks of artisans and scientists in the past relate to today's hackerspaces. They represent an open and experimental knowledge, contrasting with Bacon's institutionalized science. These prototypes highlight time as a factor enabling tinkering and networking rather than supporting a status quo.\",\n\"questions\": [\"How do prototypes and informal networks from the past connect to modern hackerspaces?\", \"How does the knowledge approach of 17th-century artisans contrast with Bacon's?\", \"What role does time play in these artisan prototypes?\"]}\n"
