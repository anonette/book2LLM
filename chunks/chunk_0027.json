Academy is an institution that tricks the na\u00efve public into gambling and indulging in a complex game with mechanical toys designed by the scientist to fundraise and support their projects. Instead of serving the aristocrats like Salomon's house, Leibnz's academy engages the public and creates a space for scientific and technological wonders that perform various functions from entertainment to state surveillance. Leibniz describes this as a \u2018Theater of Nature and Art\u2019, mixing performances and operas with scientific experiments, exhibitions of mechanical toys, various new media, exotic plants, and animal species.\",\n        \"summary\": \"Leibniz's 'Academy of Games and Pleasures' is an institution that engages the public in a 'casino-like' setting to support scientific and technological projects. It provides a hybrid space of science, technology, and entertainment, described as a 'Theater of Nature and Art'.\",\n        \"questions\": [\"What is the purpose of Leibniz's 'Academy of Games and Pleasures'?\", \"How does the academy engage the public?\", \"What kind of experiences does the academy provide?\"]\n    },\n    {\"content\": \"The goal of the scientific casino is to support the public interest in the future and bring together different \u2018stakeholders\u2019 and initiate various projects instead of only one, Instauratio. Leibniz describes this institution as a \u2018general clearing house for inventions\u2019 that matches potential investors with inventors and scientists. Coupled with a \u2018museum of everything that could be imagined\u2019, \u2018museums of rarities\u2019, a menagerie, observatory, anatomical theater, it entertains, educates, and shocks. The examples Leibniz uses to describe this hybrid and complex R&D institution form a unique 17. century political and social experiment rather than a theological project.\",\n        \"summary\": \"The 'Academy of Games and Pleasures' aims to foster public interest in the future, by initiating various projects and serving as a 'clearing house' for inventions.

It brings together different actors and stakeholders to imagine new futures instead of restoring one idealized future from the past. Inspired by 16. and 17. century cabinets of curiosities (Kunstkammer, Wunderkammer) with natural and artificial rarities (rerum naturalium, curiosa), Leibniz's academy mobilized the political and economic elites and opened the wonders of science and technology to the public. It\u2019s main function was to democratize future-making over prototypes without insisting on any pre-given ideal.\",\n        \"summary\": \"Leibniz's academy is driven by the flow of money, attention, and public support, and not by a divine plan.

It used bottom-up engagements and prototypes common in today's incubators, community labs, and hackerspaces. The kinds of engagements Leibniz envisioned over prototypes are still critical to saving the future and time as a public good. As we will see in the next chapter, we still use prototypes to experiment with the social organization of research as much as with science and technology. In Leibniz and later, prototyping combines personal and social values and interests with knowledge of nature. It acts as a probe into shared futures negotiated through experimentation.\",\n        \"summary\": \"Leibniz's academy set a precedent for open and democratized future-making, using bottom-up engagements and prototypes, elements we see in today's incubators and hackerspaces.

In short, Leibniz's Academy does not support science and technology as God's plan for humanity, but mobilizes citizens to participate in a creative project that opens the future to diverse goals and ideas. It is a vision of a future-making environment that brings people from different backgrounds together to work on common goals, so that those who are good at \u2018defraying expenses\u2019 will help those who \u2018constantly invent new things\u2019 (Ibid.).\",\n        \"summary\": \"Leibniz emphasizes the importance of financial autonomy for his academy.
