The proposal for public and exploratory sandboxes emphasizes open and public environments to experiment with the future as a matter of technology and governance. Instead of repeating the grand narratives of homo faber who will save and fix the world with every new technology promising to achieve the final ideal of a moral community or Instauratio, we define the makers as homo ludens. They are playful citizens who enjoy their free time as otium as much as an opportunity to engage with others in vita activa.

His last name (Caesus) literally meant \u2018blind\u2019 for reasons, which remain only speculative, but seem to imply the brute force he used to impose a technological change without political consensus or process.
