The idea of a state as a technical apparatus, or what we call algorithmic governance, was born with the metaphor of the Leviathan: \u2018The intrinsic logic of the \u2018state\u2019 of a man-made artificial product does not culminate in a person but in a machine. Not the representation by a person, but the factual, current accomplishment of genuine protection is what the state is all about. Representation is nothing if it is not tutela praesens. However, this can only be attained by an effectively functioning command mechanism. The state that came into being in the 17th century and prevailed on the continent of Europe is, in fact, a product of men and differs from all earlier kinds of political units [...]. (Ibid.)\", \n\"The Hobbesian modern state leads directly to the present algorithmic (or technological) governance. It is the original prototype of absolute and arbitrary power that nothing can resist because everyone will be willing to submit to it: \u2018[T]hat state was created not only an essential intellectual or sociological precondition for the technical-industrial age that followed, but also the typical, even prototypical, work of the new technological era, the development of the state itself.  (Ibid.) Schmitt\u2019s state as a \u2018product of human calculation\u2019 necessarily leads to automation, a technically perfect mechanism that is synonymous with absolute authority that performs its structure: \u2018But the idea of the state as a technically completed, manmade magnum-artificium, a machine that realizes \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018truth\u2019 only in itself\u2014namely, in its performance and function\u2014was first grasped by Hobbes and systematically constructed by him into a clear concept. The connection between the highest degree of technical neutrality and the highest authority is, as a matter of fact, not alien to the ingenious thinkers of the 17th century. At the end of Campanella\u2019s vision of the \u2018Sun State\u2019, there appears a large ship without a rudder and a sail but driven by a mechanism that is commanded and guided by the possessor of \u2018absolute authority\u2019 [...]. (Ibid.)\",\n\"Algorithmic governance as a modern Leviathan is thus a \u2018gigantic mechanism in the service of ensuring the physical protection of those governed\u2019 that leads directly to cybernetic and military visions of warships in the past (Campanella) and the present. Schmitt quotes Ernst J\u00fcnger\u2019s vision of warships as \u2018swimming outposts of enormous power, armored compartments, in which the claim to power is compressed in a narrow space.\u2019 Campanella\u2019s vision of the \u2018Sun state\u2019 becomes literal: \u2018The technically perfect mechanism of a large ship in the hands of an absolute authority who determines its course\u2019. (Ibid.)\",\n\"Exploratory Sandbox Supporting Tactical and participatory automation Is there any alternative to the absolute victory of the modern state as an algorithmic machine, a cybernetic warship that performs sovereignty through its structure and code while claiming to guarantee survival rather than justice or any value? How to rethink algorithmic sovereignty beyond the images of the Leviathan and its shadow, the Wicker Man? Instead of insisting on one or the other mythical figures, we propose multiplying them through sandboxes. In these zoos for \u2018dangerous\u2019 algorithms, participants (stakeholders) can experiment with the gradual process of \u2018domestication\u2019 of algorithms. Simulation of decision-making processes in the sandbox combines smart contracts with existing policy tools for regulation.\",\n\"It balances algorithmic \u2018wilderness\u2019 with domestication through regulations.\", \n\"This vision of governance over prototypes in the sandboxes engages and supports rather than depriving citizens of agency. Instead of yielding power to one powerful super-platform (Lockean lion or Hobbesian Leviathan), sandboxes teach citizens to live with the wild animals (algorithms) and gradually domesticate them. The exploratory and public sandboxes for algorithmic services offer a model on how to make the automation process more \u2018representational\u2019 and participatory, so it is clear at each step what we sacrifice and outsource to the code.\",\n\"We tested such a gradual process of algorithmic domestication and participation on the example of future services in an imaginary smart village of Lithopy. The format of the workshop enabled participants to understand the technology and influence the design of smart contracts while introducing templates regulations. While exploring how to combine technology with existing institutions, participants tested possible algorithmic sovereignty beyond Leviathan- and Wicker-man-style automation.\",\n\"The Lithopy sandbox, as a \u2018fairy tale with code\u2019 and design fiction movie, supported the participation in technological futures and algorithmic governance. As a functional prototype of services for a community using satellite data to trigger a transaction, it made clear what is at stake in such futures. Citizens, as participants in the workshop, experienced various degrees of automation and regulation to define comfortable levels of personal autonomy and algorithmic governance. It helped them investigate the power of technology while understanding the different possibilities of their agency through regulation to curb the power of algorithms. In this sense, it served the objective of tactical, situated and \u2018participatory\u2019 automation that embeds social and personal agency in algorithm design processes. The sandbox as a trading zone for \u2018regulation through dissonance\u2019 transformed \u2018the logic of binary states, yes and no, into fuzzy states of maybes and maybe\u2019 (Galison, 1997).\",\n\"The playful and liminal environment supported the use of regulations and codes as tactics that seek ways to resist the structure of algorithmic governance (Certeau, 2011). As an environment for \u2018tactical\u2019 and \u2018situated\u2019 automation that is participatory and liminal, the sandbox involved citizens directly as individuals and an ad hoc group: \u2018These workshops support participation in automation by engaging human participants directly in the creation of technologies that are also strategically used to control their daily practices through the dominant sociotechnical order, but with tactical intention in this sense, these participatory workshops make the actual physical production of the boards, which is tedious part of a community bonding experience that supports peer economy and liberation rather than alienation of labor. \u2018 (Hee-jeong Choi et al., 2020)\",\n\"The exploratory sandbox thus extends the functions of the liminal environments described in Chapter 3 or the workshops in the hackerspaces described in the article on situated and participatory automation (Ibid.). It enables citizens to directly understand what is at stake in the code and regulation while participating in their tweaking and development. In the case of the Lithopy sandbox, participants used the Hyperledger fabric blockchain as a \u2018testnet\u2019 on a server, where it was possible to check prototypes of smart contracts that use open satellite data (from Sentinel 2A and 2B) for various services and automation. As villagers, they would sign contracts after watching a near-future scenario in a fantasy design fiction movie. They would negotiate interventions and changes after witnessing a discriminatory contract excluding certain nationalities from buying property in the village.\",\n\"The Lithopy sandbox offered an experience of agency over the code and regulation for a concrete community. It supported the goal of experimental and experimentalist governance as a process of negotiation and consensus building in a power vacuum where individual stakeholders have to define their interests and relations, but also norms and goals on the go (Sabel & Zeitlin, 2012). Although most regulatory sandboxes insist on innovation, the Lithopy sandbox was always a \u2018trade zone\u2019, a productive environment to support coordination and exchanges of knowledge and resources between different and even antagonistic stakeholders. We describe this as tactical and situated automation that preserves personal and social agency.\"],\n\"summary\": [\"The author discusses the concept of a modern state as an artificial entity, which has enabled later forms of industrial states to use new technologies for sovereignty.
