They restore the ancient rites of the emperors over the calendar and time and connect cosmology, ontology, and politics to serve the teleological goal of restoration: \u2018Janus-like sense of instauro (establish/restore) accommodates this powerful complimentary paradox, emphatically suggesting masculine imperial power over time itself. Instauro here comes to be associated with the cyclical conception of history as a recurring pattern of fluorescence and decline, a conception that governed the historical consciousness of the Romans. Where before a priest or public official had the authority to extend public religious festivals by decreeing \u2018Instauration\u2019 or repetitions of them (as reported in Livy and Cicero), here it is the whole society and world that the highest official, the deified emperor, can revivify through festive rituals.\u2019 (Ibid.)\",\n   \"summary\": \"This paragraph explains how new patrons of time and science aim to restore the imperial power over time and the future by using new instruments.

For Bacon, prototypes are tools of the \u2018masculine birth of time\u2019 whose purpose is to empower patrons who invest in science and technology. Instead of exploring various uses for cosmological, political, and social knowledge and values, such prototypes have only one goal: to hijack God's program and serve the patrons. The prototypes set the stage for the algorithmic rule and reduce all politics to control over the R&D process and innovation.\",\n   \"summary\": \"This paragraph elaborates on Bacon's concept of 'time' and 'Instauratio' as part of the political uses of science and technology in the 16th and 17th centuries.
