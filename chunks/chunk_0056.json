This thought experiment, formulated by legendary computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra (Dijkstra, 1971), served to challenge students and colleagues to develop original algorithms and solve the time-sharing problem in computing. Dijkstra needed a provocation to inspire a search for different ways for processes and peripherals to \\\"share\\\" access to a common processor. The dining philosopher allegory helped him define the \\\"concurrent\\\" programming algorithms that enable all modern computers. It is a through experiment that influenced all subsequent computing challenges of synchronization and coordination in distributed computing networks. It also defined all governance problems as control over time and the future.\",\n      \"summary\": \"The 1965 \\\"Dining Philosophers\\\" allegory, formulated by Edsger Dijkstra, was a thought experiment that challenged the development of innovative algorithms and addressed the time-sharing problem in computing.

Would other aspects of food commensality, such as hospitality to strangers, social bonding and socialization rituals, or hierarchies in ceremonial communion, generate different algorithms for modern computers? What would our networks look like if we used metaphors of dance and choreography instead of battles? Would a close reading of Carl von Clausewitz's themes of chance and uncertainty in war change the way we understand the synchronization of nodes? Do we still need provocative thought experiments and metaphors to foster future technological change? The exploratory and public sandboxes are environments that support such questions and explorations, enabling rich and complex relationships between concepts, metaphors and algorithms, governance, and technology.\",\n      \"summary\": \"The role of thought experiments and metaphors in shaping technological developments is explored, questioning whether these are random or influenced by period-specific concerns like Cold War game theory.

For example, \\\"Dining Philosophers\\\" ignores the rich anthropological context of food commensality or the philosophical issues with the senses. Instead, the metaphor offers a comic challenge: we are asked to coordinate philosophers who are unable to eat and think at the same time while seated around a common plate. However, an innovative and groundbreaking algorithm emerged from this extreme and absurd scenario. It solved a problem in concurrent computing, but no one would ever claim that this algorithm will become an actual dining experience. The purpose of the absurd thought experiment was to ground the challenge in an everyday experience and free the imagination. It solved a technical challenge without claiming a superior dining experience.\",\n      \"summary\": \"Early thought experiments and metaphors, like the 'Dining Philosophers', abstracted from social, historical or political contexts to solve specific technical challenges.
