We will show how they democratize science but also decisions about science in the case of hormones and the politics related to insulin and estrogen issues. Hormones play an essential role in the social, medical, and economic issues with male infertility, diabetes, (trans)gender identities, patient rights, etc. While the two insulin projects (Hypodiabetic blog42 by Timothy Olmer and \u2018Open Insulin Project\u201943 by Counter Culture Labs) delineate the possibilities and limits of pragmatic and emancipatory prototypes, the project on \u2018Open Source Estrogen\u2019 questions the whole idea of public good and emancipation by medical and technological means. They show different engagements with the future and questions of agency. \",\n     \"summary\": \"The text discusses the non-utilitarian uses of prototypes in science, with a focus on the democratizing role they play in decisions about hormones, insulin, and estrogen.

Omer reused several medical devices to create his own \u2018artificial pancreas\u2019, an insulin pump using an algorithm he designed to manage his diabetes. The personalized and disruptive device monitors in real time the insulin levels and microdoses of the patient. With this, he changed the usual model of uploading data and waiting for expert advice on insulin uptake.

The ontological status of the estrogen molecules is directly connected to political decisions; it is a matter of Kairos rather than only knowledge and insight. Furthermore, open source tools for the synthesis and monitoring of estrogen serve personal explorations of estrogen issues but also as a tool to mobilize the public and rethink the possibility of collective action.\",\n     \"summary\": \"The Open Estrogen Project uses non-utilitarian, artistic and exploratory prototypes to address issues related to xenoestrogen pollution, gender politics, and patient rights.
