Behind every military technology, Coetzee identifies the cosmic ambitions of Earth\u2019s \u2018celestial sons\u2019 (humans and their rockets, etc.) who want to destroy old myths and leave \u2018mother Earth\u2019 to mate with new worlds and create new myths: \u2018But has the master myth of history not outdated the fiction of earth and heaven? We live no longer by tilling the earth but by devouring her and her waste products. We signed our repudiation of her with flights toward new celestial loves. We have the capacity to breed out of our own head\u2026. In Indo-China we play out the drama of the end of the tellurian age and the marriage of the sky-god with his parthonegene daughter-queen. If the play has been poor, it is because we have stumbled about the stage asleep, not knowing the meaning of our acts. Now I bring their meaning to light in that blinding moment of ascending meta-historical consciousness in which we begin to shape our own myths (Ibid..).  \",\n     \"summary\": \"Coetzee delves into the concept of advanced technology being used as a tool for military expeditions, which in turn, devours the earth's resources.

Instead of monopolies, war, and annihilation, prototyping described in this book supports the experience of time and future as Kairos, mundane opportunities for change, but also uncontrollable chance. It means time as expression of personal agency against the totalitarian ideals of \u2018meta-historical consciousness\u2019 with its teleological projects, celestial sons, and apocalyptic futures.

Galison was able to show how successful exchanges between various stakeholders (scientists, but also policymakers and businesses) depended on the importance of preserving their identity and diversity, event potential conflicts. Instead of finding a single unified theory, practice, value or institution, innovation (and we claim also regulation) depends on the plurality and dissent as experiences of Kairos. Neither the absolute power of the code nor some predefined values should define the common algorithmic and automated future, but the ability to \u2018trade\u2019 with groups and stakeholders we do not understand or agree on: \u2018But here we can learn from the anthropologists who regularly study unlike cultures that do interact, most notably by trade. Two groups can agree on rules of exchange even if they ascribe utterly different significance to the objects being exchanged; they may even disagree on the meaning of the exchange process itself. Nonetheless, the trading partners can hammer out a local coordination despite vast global differences. In an even more sophisticated way, cultures in interaction frequently establish contact languages, systems of discourse that can vary from the most function-specific jargons, through semispecific pidgins, to full-fledged creoles rich enough to support activities as complex as poetry and metalinguistic reflection.\u2019 (Ibid..)\",\n     \"summary\": \"Inspired by a metaphor used by Peter Galison, the author proposes the idea of exploratory and public 'sandboxes' as 'trading zones' for innovation, discovery, and regulation.
