Blockchain, the Internet of Things (IoT) and various cloud services (SaaS, IaaS, PaaS, and CaaS software; infrastructure, platform, and containers as a service) synchronize nodes, processes, and data across networks. From satellite navigation to algorithmic trading, time is traded, measured, and quantified as a commodity through computers and atomic clocks. It is even \u2018minted\u2019 and \u2018stamped\u2019 on blockchain and decentralized blockchain ledgers, which define time as a literal medium of currency. As a resource, time quantifies and controls processes in machines and networks, but as a personal or social experience, it is the opposite of control. It makes human life unique, unrepeatable, sacred, and \u2018autotelic\u2019, having a meaning and purpose in itself (Cassin 2014). The purpose of this book is to rethink prototyping and design that uses the future and time as a medium of personal and social agency (Kairos), rather than reducing it to a resource and part of a cosmology (Chronos).\",\n      \"summary\": \"The paragraph describes time as a crucial resource for infrastructures that promise automation and how it is traded, measured, and quantified as a commodity.

[that] revel in heterogeneity\u2019 and \u2018enter into a relationship of tension with various present-day moments, relativize them and render them more decisive\u2019 (Zielinski 2006). Prototypes can help us recognize missed opportunities in the past (Sections 2.2. and 2.3), but also the present \u2018dynamic moments\u2019 of change and transformation. These moments matter as possibilities for action rather than ontological or cosmological resignation and certainty. To capture the experience of prototyping as a matter of agency over the future and time, we will use the dichotomy of Kairos and Chronos (Sections 2.2, 2.3 and 3.0) and define time as a medium of action and politics rather than a matter of ontology or cosmology. As political subjects, citizens use the future and time as Kairos, an opportunity. As users and consumers, they are controlled by the promises of the new infrastructures that represent time as control over the future based on insights into Chronos and cosmology.\",\n      \"summary\": \"The paragraph talks about the importance of recognizing dynamic moments and changes to prevent the loss of agency over the future and time.

By \u2018expanding the present\u2019 and \u2018slowing down\u2019 (Ibid.) the original control infrastructure, the clock, we will recognize the moments of loss of personal and social agency in the future and time. Following the genealogy of automation in Chapter 2 and the practices in hackerspaces in Chapter 3, we will then question the demarcation of technology from governance, structure from agency, and time as Chronos from Kairos. In doing so, we plan to highlight hybrid practices and liminal environments that increase our agency in relation to the future and time. They offer an alternative to the governance machines that reduced the future to algorithmic domination, automation, and Chronos.\",\n      \"summary\": \"The paragraph discusses how the genealogy of automation explores the tension between Kairos and Chronos.

The dichotomy between the quantified and controlled time of instruments and infrastructures (Chronos) and the unpredictable and experiential time of life (Kairos) defines the central questions in this book: How can we design instruments and infrastructures that support agency over time and the future rather than taking it away? How to support personal and social action in prototyping (Chapter 3)? How to develop infrastructures without becoming their victims, slaves, and parasites (Chapters 2 and 4)?\",\n      \"summary\": \"The paragraph contrasts time as a means of automation with time as a matter of personal and social agency that includes unpredictability.
