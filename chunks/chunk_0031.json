The instruments defined the teleological project of progress and Instauratio, but also the possibility of plural and hybrid visions of society based on prototyping and new instruments. Present-day geeks, tinkerers, amateur scientists, and activists in the hackerspaces and makerspaces revive this tradition. They explore the alternatives to the teleological mission of Instauratio and control over time and the future as Chronos. Practices and prototypes outside the official R&D labs, industry, and university centers support plural goals and values that present experiments with the community, governance, and institutions that preserve the open future.\",\n      \"summary\": \"The concept of Kairos, which emphasizes social and personal agency in prototyping, is being revived in today's society by geeks, tinkerers, amateur scientists, and activists.
