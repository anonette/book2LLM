We discussed this in previous chapters as self-determination and freedom to discover, innovate, and most importantly to make political decisions about the future. Only by separating the personal and social life from the experience of ontology or cosmology (discussed as Kairos and Chronos, agency and structure) can we transform both as matters of technology and governance.\",\n      \"summary\": \"The text discusses the importance of separating Chronos and Kairos, algorithms and metaphors in understanding the significance of personal and collective power over time and the future.

Such teleological projects of progress and restoration further reduce the possibility of politics, discovery, and innovation (Sections 2.3 and 2.4). Current ML and DLT algorithms too often ignore their historical, accidental, and metaphorical origins and claim to offer better governance while ignoring the main issue of governance, which is the division of power and the prevention of arbitrary rules. Fantasies of algorithmic rules modeled on predictive AI, consensus mechanisms, or trustless protocols for synchronizing data on ledgers claim to be an absolute public good for the only one best future. They reduce the governance questions to the management of nodes synchronized by consensus mechanisms and predicted by models. Such reduction of metaphors to algorithms follows the reduction of kairos to chronos and governance to ritual and technology that we discussed in sections 1 and 2.1, 2.2.  It is a reduction that claims that algorithms will solve not only technical challenges but also social and political problems.\",\n      \"summary\": \"Without distinguishing metaphors from algorithms and the concepts of Chronos and Kairos, governance risks becoming a technocratic dream that hampers politics, discovery, and innovation.

It is a myth that reduces both governance and technology from opportunity (kairos) to an ideal structure and chronos (ideal algorithm and technology that solves all political challenges or promises progress and restoration).  Everything collapses into a kind of superior synchronization of nodes and actors under a model based on predefined protocols and values with questionable governance of the actual code or parameters and weights. The synchronization under Chronos as time, cycles, patterns and algorithms leads to a monopoly of one infrastructure and value system that closes the future for the many reduced to mere parasites. Citizens, as users of an infrastructure that manages and predicts their behavior, become nodes that are expected to execute the pre-agreed and pre-programmed code, values, or models, with no agency to change them.\",\n      \"summary\": \"The text identifies a 'myth of automation', where metaphors are reduced to algorithms, and agency is reduced to technical infrastructure.

Governance then becomes a matter of compliance with various regulations, laws, and institutional codes of conduct or industry standards that maintain the status quo and serve the new insight or infrastructure. To make the processes of designing new infrastructure and policies more democratic and open, we need to involve the public in the entire cycle of innovation and governance, from prototyping to implementation and regulation.
