Drebbel\u2019s instrument supported open-ended explorations of science, technology, and society. Unlike Bacon\u2019s academy, Drebbel\u2019s informal network of so-called \u2018book of friends\u2019 (alba amicorum), something of Renaissance Facebook, had no fixed agendas nor ideals of a theological and teleological order in nature (or society). The informal networks of prototyping geeks showed science and technology as a matter of friendship and sharing of material, poetic, and social explorations similar to the hackerspace projects discussed in the next chapter.\",\n\"summary\": \"The author contrasts Drebbel\u2019s open-ended explorations of science, technology, and society with Bacon\u2019s academy's teleological approach.

They combine mechanical arts, natural philosophy, and \u2018courts\u2019 (politics) to explore radical visions, such as Bornitz\u2019 transgender body politic (Keller, 2015). For Renaissance artisans, such as Drebbel, both nature and society are continuously transforming in ways we cannot predicted nor fully control. Instead of restoring the pre-given order of Chronos, the goal is to embrace curiosity, openness and opportunity of Kairos: \u2018This idea was ingeniously encapsulated in a posthumous emblem book that illustrates Bornitz\u2019s key ideas through the figure of a transsexual. The Latin tag warned, \u2018Through a wonder of nature, a male appears in place of the female/ and she who was your wife will now be your husband (Mir a naturae vice faemina nasculus [ sic ] extat,/Et quae sponsa fuit, jam tibi sponsus erit).\u2019Chroniclers of wonders offered many accounts of sudden sex changes that dramatically illustrated nature\u2019s constant ability to surprise. Such transformations could not be predicted beforehand according to reason, as the German emblem indicated, \u2018Nature often brings forth something new/Which Reason thinks impossible (Offt die Natur was newes bringt/ So die Vernunfft unm o glich findt)\u2019.

Named after the mythical king, the academy serves the project of Instauratio and fulfils God's promise to humanity. Science and technology as expert knowledge and experience of time as Chronos become means by which humanity restores its power after the mythical fall. In contrast to Bacon\u2019s academy as Solomon's House, Drebbel's folly of empiricism or Bornitz's transgender body politics and even political artisanship use instruments and prototypes to perform the future as open to engagement and radical visions. With their emphasis on public engagement and democratization, these projects dream of a society as a kind of republic of artisans (Keller, 2015).\",\n\"summary\": \"The author contrasts the metaphor of Bacon's Solomon's House, representing a return to power through expert knowledge, with Drebbel's open, democratic, and radical vision of a future, embodied by a society of artisans.\",\n\"questions\": [\n\"What does Solomon's House represent in Bacon's context?\",\n\"How does Drebbel's vision contrast with that of Bacon's Solomon's House?\",\n\"What does a society as a kind of republic of artisans mean?\"\n]\n}\n]\n}"
