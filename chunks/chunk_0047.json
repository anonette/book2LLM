Once China\u2019s policy makers coopted this promise to serve the CCP nationalist agendas of the CCP, it simply collapsed into a cynical PR campaign around 2015. The pre-2015 liminal communitas was a complex milieu of patented, pirated, and open-sourced technologies that created an ecosystem between hackerspaces, open hardware accelerators, and manufacturers. It enabled makers, entrepreneurs, and hackers from all over the world to freely explore the new political and economic networks. Not all projects and networks lead to successes, but even the failures, as we will show in the next chapter, offered a valuable lesson in the importance of Kairos in governance and technology over prototypes.\",\n\"summary\": \"This paragraph discusses the innovative potential of Shenzhen, China and how it fostered a community of hackers, makers, and visionaries before it was co-opted by the Chinese government. It highlights the dynamic mix of patented, pirated, and open-source technologies. It emphasises that both successful and failed projects contribute to understanding governance and technology.\",\n\"questions\": [\n\"What is the significance of Shenzhen in the world of innovation?\",\n\"How did the government's co-opting affect the innovation scene in Shenzhen?\",\n\"What role did failures play in the development of governance and technology in Shenzhen?\"\n]\n},\n{\n\"title\": \"Dream-Works in the Republic of Garages\",\n\"content\": \"The self-described \u2018network of workshops and garages\u2019 combined the hacker ethos with new models of crowdfunding and traditional business practices, such as patents and the multinational, networked structure of affiliates almost mocking the corporate pan-global structures. The goal of the garage network was to produce disruptive, low-tech prototypes that provide solutions to developed and developing countries in terms of energy efficiency (such as small solar panels for mobile phones or other examples of leapfrogging). MIT graduates, Alex Hornstein and Shawn Frayne, envisioned the network of garages as a cooperation with local teams of tinkerers in the developing countries interested in the design of future clean confluent technologies (Frayne, n.d.), such as the low-tech solar panels and wind turbines.\",\n\"summary\": \"This paragraph describes a 'network of workshops and garages' aiming to produce disruptive, low-tech prototypes aimed at improving energy efficiency in developed and developing countries. It highlights the roles of MIT graduates Alex Hornstein and Shawn Frayne in leading the initiative.\",\n\"questions\": [\n\"What was the main goal of the 'network of workshops and garages'?\",\n\"How does this network combine the hacker ethos with new business models?\",\n\"What type of technology are Hornstein and Frayne interested in developing?\"]\n},\n{\n\"title\": \"Sociotechnical Rites of Passage\",\n\"content\": \"The project failed but brought visibility to the material conditions of design and production and its role in politics. The independent, ad hoc and mobile R&D centers, the garages in Delhi, Shenzhen, and Manila, together with fablabs, hackerspaces and similar institutions around the world, are still the sites where we can dream and experience the liminal prototypes, such as the nonturbine wind generators (Hong Kong/Hawaii)65 underwater drones (Octo23 in Paris)66  etc. They are sites and projects that opened our imagination about the future and our engagement with it through prototypes.\",\n\"summary\": \"This paragraph reveals that despite the project's failure, it shed light on the real-world conditions of design and production, and its influence in politics. It cites several locations around the world that continue to inspire and experiment with liminal prototypes.\",\n\"questions\": [\n\"What was the impact of the project's failure?\",\n\"What role do these independent R&D centers play in innovation?\",\n\"How do these sites and projects contribute to our understanding of the future?\"]\n}\n]\n}"
