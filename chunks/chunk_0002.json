The material, conceptual and social engagements with prototypes and sandboxes described in Chapters 3 and 4 enable a different approach to time and the future. They reject any teleology of final causes in history, society, or the universe.

In Chapter 2, we will outline how prototypes support Kairos and Chronos and identify forgotten practices and aspirations that expand the possibilities of engagement with time, technology, and governance (Chapter 3). Based on these present and past practices, we will outline a model for exploratory sandboxes as liminal environments (Chapter 4) for experiencing alternatives to automation and algorithmic rules.

To challenge the pursuit of automation with its teleology of time control, we examine the histories of instrument making in ancient Greece and the Renaissance (Sections 2.3 and 2.4). Together with the ethnography of instruments made in hackerspaces (Chapter 3) and other liminal environments (Sections 3.1 and 3.2), these chapters define prototypes that support public uses of time and agency over the futures.

The genealogy is an essential part of this proposal for prototyping for governance in the exploratory and public sandboxes (Chapter 4). It identifies the forgotten anxieties and fantasies of governance as automation (Chapter 2) and questions control over the future and time.

Emerging technologies modeled after the devil's bridge and pacts with the devil often promise such unrestricted and absolute power with a hidden clause about the future. It is a promise of an infrastructure that enforces automation without participation and agency over the future.
