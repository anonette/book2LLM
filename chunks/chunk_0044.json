Coleman\u2019s account seems to support our emphasis on ambiguous and liminal governance over prototypes that prioritize Kairos in governance and technology. It differs from Lindtner\u2019s description of present attempts to prototype and govern in maker movements  (S. M. Lindtner, 2020) that strengthen the neoliberal order and various exploitations.\",\n\"summary\": \"The text discusses the various interpretations of free and open software movements, focusing on the ambiguous governance over prototypes that prioritize Kairos in governance and technology.

The prototypes promise to ameliorate the \u2018institutional structures of inequality, exploitation, and injustice\u2019 through technology, but they further the neoliberal agenda of \u2018individual self-upgrade and economic development\u2019 (Ibid.). Lindtner\u2019s ethnographic account of maker movements in the USA and China shows various examples of how prototypes support colonization and modernization through \u2018technological dreams of future making\u2019 that strengthen only \u2018demand for a particular kind of future\u2019 (Ibid.).\",\n\"summary\": \"Lindtner views prototyping as a 'promissory technology' that perpetuates the modernist colonial project and social injustices.

While Coleman examines the tensions between communitarian and liberal (even libertarian) leans in free and open-source software projects as a challenge to understand how governance and technology mix, Lindtner\u2019s account shows a cynical misuse of the rhetoric around prototyping to support further violence and exclusions.\",\n\"summary\": \"Promissory prototypes generate subtle technological change that obscures violent and controlling actions carried out in the name of innovation.

For Coleman, this ambiguity and paradoxes are the reason for a more in-depth inquiry into the role of infrastructure and prototyping in society, not a reason to reject the whole idea of governance over prototypes. The debate about implicit, explicit, and failed attempts at maker and hackers\u2019 governance over prototypes repeats in this sense the classic 17th and 18th century political philosophy debate whether a state based on natural philosophy or atheism could exist (Devellennes, 2017; Schulman, 2009).\",\n\"summary\": \"According to Lindtner, the maker movement insists on using prototypes as governance tools, resulting in 'ambivalent alliances' and 'partially compromised ideals'.

Instead of an ideal community including utopias of classless society or social justice, prototypes support radically open, agonistic, and uncertain futures through practice and material engagements. They offer a critique of the hierarchical and closed world (and time) without stating a clear agenda for the future.
