Therefore, the relationship between action and knowledge in Aristotle's version of the story leads to the monopoly on olive presses so \u2018when the season arrived, there was a sudden demand for several presses at the same time, and by letting them out on what terms he (Thales) liked, he realized a large sum of money\u2019 (Ibid.).\",\n      \"summary\": \"Thales, according to the anecdotes, used his knowledge of Chronos to create a tool that helped him control time and achieve a monopoly.
