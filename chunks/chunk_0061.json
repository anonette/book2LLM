It placed the workshop participants in an imaginary \u2018smart village\u2019 with functional prototypes of smart contracts, templates, and guided the participants through decision making on a common future as an imaginary community. In the workshops, participants tested how to connect their expectations expressed in natural language with the regulations and code without prioritizing any regulatory force (market, culture, technology, or law). The sandbox supported a playful \u2018regulation through dissonance\u2019 between the different forces and visualized the results of the negotiations on Tableau78.\",\n\"summary\": \"Lithopy is an exploratory sandbox for emerging blockchain services using satellite data to automate smart contracts. It was designed to foster 'innovation through dissonance' and act as a 'trading zone'.

During the workshop in 2019 and 2020, it gradually became a sandbox that emphasized the participation of stakeholders in smart contracts over a method that translated natural language, code and regulations into each other. The village existed as a simulated ledger on a server (testnet) that the participants inhabited over 2- to 4-hour workshops, during which they would learn the basics of technology, familiarize themselves with different tools, and also test the possibilities of different regulatory tools.\",\n\"summary\": \"Started in 2019, Lithopy served as a near-future simulation for exploring predictive governance of future blockchain infrastructures using satellite and drone data. Over time, it evolved into a sandbox focusing on stakeholder participation in smart contracts.

In 2019 most participants expressed a strong interest in hybrid, on-chain, and off-chain combination of code and regulations, but also complained about a lack of skills and tools to do that. The most important outcome of the 2019 workshops became a proposal for an environment or service that supports participants in giving feedback in their natural language about the regulations and also code. This led to the idea of a hybrid sandbox that uses the model of regulatory sandboxes to support more participatory and public engagements in concrete scenarios of algorithmic services and governance.\",\n\"summary\": \"Participants had an active role in modifying the code for the testnet, making decisions about future service regulations.

The artistic aspect of the project created an intentional ambiguity to support creative engagements with the code and regulations. Contracts to become a citizen, marry, and owning property govern life in the imaginary \u2018smart village\u2019 of a a Lithopy consisting of functional permissioned blockchain platform.

As one of the participants commented, the simulation made him feel left out of future decision-making processes that were \u2018outsourced to Silicon Valley code and the regulations of elites of the EU commission.\u2019 Based on this feedback, we redesigned Lithopy in 2020 to become a \u2018contact language\u2019 or \u2018trade zone\u2019 for programming and regulation through natural language.\",\n\"summary\": \"Participants, playing the role of villagers, explored the blockchain interface and used templates of the smart contracts to deliberate on potential regulations.

The creation of a contact language or environment for learning, exchanging, and interacting proved crucial in this second phase. It was not about designing an interface that translates and formalizes code or rules of satellite smart contracts into natural language, but rather to increase the motivation for interaction and negotiation between the participants.
