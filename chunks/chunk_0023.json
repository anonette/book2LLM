This model entailed a close association between the body of the artisan and the content of his own natural philosophy encapsulated within his single personal device. By contrast, the thermoscope/thermometer, as a specialized metric instrument rather than a universal demonstration, suggested a diverse range of individuals and an equally wide array of experiments. The instrument was not itself an experiment, but a tool to be used in many experiments.
