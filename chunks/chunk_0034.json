In this meeting, we defined the challenges of OSH prototyping that serves research as much as the \u2018technological transparency and public oversight\u2019 (Ibid.) of research. OSH became an explicit example of prototyping that connects science, technology, and governance. It not only improves the oversight and public perception of science, but also engages citizens and enable them to \u2018create, obtain, study, modify, distribute, use and share (science instruments) designs\u2019 (Ibid..) in a variety of contexts. Instead of mobilizing citizens to accept new entities, such as vacuum in the case of the air pump, or new sources of authority, such as the expert scientists, OSH prototypes support sharing, working together, and reflecting science and technology with friends in various formal and informal settings.\", \"summary\": \"The Open Science Hardware manifesto, formulated in 2016, emphasizes the openness of scientific instruments and their use in research. It promotes citizen engagement in science and technology, advocating for transparency and public oversight.\", \"questions\": [\"What is the Open Science Hardware manifesto?\", \"How does the manifesto promote citizen engagement in science?\", \"What was the purpose of the meeting at CERN in 2016?\"]},\n{\"title\": \"Science Artisans as Modern Thaleses\", \"paragraph\": \"The prototyping of open science and DIY instruments revives the artisanal approach to science and technology that emphasizes Kairos. It bridges the divides between various domains of knowledge (engineering, humanities, art, science) and civic virtues (libertarian DIY making and self-reliance versus peer culture of collaboration and communitarian values). With direct access to instruments and policy discussions, citizens gain agency and disperse the asymmetries of power. They actively define their future by connecting prototyping with governance.\", \"summary\": \"Modern science artisans are likened to Thaleses, reviving an artisanal approach to science and tech. They bridge knowledge divides and empower citizens to shape their future by prototyping and governance.\", \"questions\": [\"What is the role of modern science artisans?\", \"How does prototyping link to governance?\", \"What domains of knowledge are bridged by this approach?\"]},\n{\"title\": \"Idiosyncratic Prototypes\", \"paragraph\": \"The prototypes of instruments that support private and public interests and aspirations simply express the experience of time, as Kairos. They enable citizens as science artisans to regain sovereignty, dignity, and freedom in an age immersed in science and technology controversies. By combining the pursuit of knowledge with the diverse needs and ideals of individuals and communities (their vita activa), or even private interests (otium), they become tools of autonomy and freedom.\", \"summary\": \"Prototypes for science instruments offer citizens an opportunity to express their time experience and regain sovereignty. They become tools of autonomy and freedom, combining the pursuit of knowledge with personal and community interests.\", \"questions\": [\"What is the purpose of these prototypes?\", \"How do prototypes enable citizens to regain sovereignty?\", \"How do these prototypes combine the pursuit of knowledge with personal interests?\"]},\n{\"title\": \"DIY makers, hackers, and artisans\", \"paragraph\": \"DIY makers, hackers, and present artisans use prototypes to interact, define, and perform what living together means in the changing sociotechnical milieu. They use tools to define their future while facing various risks and challenges, such as estrogen pollution, antibiotic crisis, emerging, and disruptive technologies.\", \"summary\": \"DIY makers, hackers, and artisans use prototypes to navigate the socio-technical landscape. They use these tools to shape their future amid challenges like pollution, antibiotic crisis, and disruptive technologies.\", \"questions\": [\"How do DIY makers, hackers, and artisans use prototypes?\", \"How do these tools help them face challenges?\", \"What risks are these individuals facing?\"]},\n{\"title\": \"Understanding Open Hardware and Citizen Science\", \"paragraph\": \"To closely follow the hybrid uses of instruments in community building, we also initiated the OCSDNET project \u2018Understanding Open Hardware and Citizen Science\u201923\\n\\nthat supported open and citizen science initiatives in the Global South. Between 2015 and 2017 we organized workshops in Indonesia, Thailand and Nepal for participants to learn how to build DIY instruments and engage with science.\", \"summary\": \"The OCSDNET project 'Understanding Open Hardware and Citizen Science' was initiated to support open and citizen science initiatives in the Global South by organizing workshops for DIY instrument building and science engagement.\", \"questions\": [\"What is the OCSDNET project?\", \"What activities were organized under this project?\", \"Where were these workshops held?\"]},\n{\"title\": \"The Present DIYbio and Open Hardware\", \"paragraph\": \"The present DIYbio (Delgado, 2013; Landrain et al., 2013; Meyer, 2015) and open hardware for science scholarships (Delgado, 2013; Landrain et al., 2013; Meyer, 2015; Pearce, 2012, 2014) often reflect upon the scientific, activist, artistic, and sometimes idiosyncratic uses of prototypes instruments. Researchers focus on how such practices change the roles of the (science) museums and science communication (Davies et al., 2015; Selin, 2015; Selin et al., 2016), how they enable the new infrastructure of independent science (DIYbio) institutions (Delfanti, 2013; Kera, 2011) or how they support a global movement of hackerspaces and makerspaces (Kera, 2012b; Moilanen, 2012; Seyfried et al., 2014).\", \"summary\": \"Current DIYbio and open hardware for science scholarships reflect on the varied uses of prototype instruments, affecting science museums and communication, enabling independent science infrastructure, and supporting a global movement of hackerspaces and makerspaces.\", \"questions\": [\"What do DIYbio and open hardware for science scholarships reflect on?\", \"How do these practices affect science museums and communication?\", \"How do they support the global movement of hackerspaces and makerspaces?\"]}"
