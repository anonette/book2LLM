Although the accusations remain ambiguous, this corruption case still haunts us because it shows how innovation (science and technology) often destroys good governance, which fully depends on personal and social agency. Public participation and inclusion in science and technology over prototypes is an alternative to this \u2018blind\u2019 prototyping that misuses power, institution and time. We need more prototyping practices that promise less in terms of an idealized future but do more for personal and social agency. They go beyond calls for transparent and public funding, open patents, and strategies to overcome technological and digital divides. They question the power of the blind homo faber as a model of innovation and governance and remind us of the homo ludens achievements in the original work of Thales and Renaissance artisans.  Homo faber and his scientific \u2018fixes\u2019 will never compensate for the lack of good governance, virtue, and agency and teach us how to balance the pursuit of knowledge and Chronos with the pursuit of an open future and time as an opportunity, Kairos, for agency and change.\", \n\"summary\": \"The paragraph discusses the negative impact of misused power and public funds in scientific and technological advancements, citing the example of the Roman Republic's engineering project, Via Appia.

Since the ancient clocks, prototyping imposes an ideal of governance as control and automation over knowledge and instruments. It is a control based on cosmological cycles and patterns in various phenomena (Chronos) that conceals the arbitrary nature of their discovery and use (Kairos), especially in governance. We have discussed this ideal of governance based on the insight into Chronos as a myth of automation. It is a myth that imposes the teleology of progress and restoration as something necessary, natural, and eternal that defines the purpose of the society.\", \n\"summary\": \"The paragraph explores the use of prototyping in governance, emphasizing how it imposes an ideal of governance based on control, automation, and the cosmological cycles and patterns. This approach often conceals the arbitrary nature of discovery and use (Kairos), thereby establishing Chronos as a myth of automation that dictates societal progress and restoration.\", \n\"questions\": [\n\"How does prototyping influence governance, according to the author?\", \n\"What is meant by the 'myth of automation' in this context?\", \n\"What is the difference between Chronos and Kairos in the context of governance and prototyping?\"]},\n\n{\"content\": \"   In what follows, we will propose a way to scale the experience of prototyping in liminal environments, or design policy process that supports Kairos and agency in technology and governance through the so-called \\\"exploratory sandboxes.
