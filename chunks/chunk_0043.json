Designing, building, and using prototypes becomes an interaction with nature but also institutions and economic models, such as open-source development, promises of blockchain technologies, data cooperatives, etc. The prototypes bring science and technology closer to leisure, art and everyday activities, otium, but also civic action and public life or vita activa (Arendt, 2013).

The prototypes broke down the barriers between craftsmen (superior artisans), university scholars (scholastic) and emerging humanists in the 16th century that represented the different forms of power and organization of the society. Today, they probe the present relations between science, technology, and society that have a similar potential to engage, transform, and inspire.\",\n     \"summary\": \"Open science hardware prototypes are breaking boundaries between different spaces and sectors, consistent with Zilsel's thesis.

On examples of open science hardware, citizen laboratories, and hackerspaces, we discuss hybrid and ambiguous networks changing the understanding of science and society. To further reflect on the role of prototypes in governance, we will look at global experiments in the ambiguous SEZ -Special Economic Zones (SEZs), where prototypes foster transnational networks and projects described as \u2018geek diplomacy\u2019 (Kera, 2015).\",\n     \"summary\": \"Prototypes are engaging new societal actors and fostering global networks in fields like open science hardware and citizen laboratories.
