Lindtner et al., 2016; Ratto & Boler, 2014). While channeling the promises of automated and distributed fabrication (Gershenfeld et al., 2004; Ratto & Ree, 2012), it gave rise to an ambiguous political and design fantasy that became a victim of its own success. The hype provoked a surge of government and policy interests in the so-called \u2018maker movements\u2019 in the US, China, Singapore, Taiwan, but also the EU leading directly to nationalist calls for \u2018Making (XYZ nation) great again\u2019.\",\n            \"summary\": \"Shenzhen, known for its open source hardware and DIY practices, became a hub of innovation and attracted attention from governments around the world, sparking a surge in 'maker movements'.\",\n            \"questions\": [\n                \"What is Shenzhen known for in the world of innovation?\",\n                \"How did Shenzhen influence global 'maker movements'?\",\n                \"What was the political impact of Shenzhen's rise as a hub for hackerspaces and makerspaces?\"\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"text\": \"The niche, exploratory, and informal transnational prototypes and networks (Kaiying & Lindtner, 2016b; Vertesi et al., 2011) described here as \u2018geek diplomacy\u2019 (Kera, 2015) became coopted by different governments to serve nationalist innovation agendas. They became what Lindtner describes as \u2018displacement\u2019 and \u2018promissory\u2019 prototypes (S. M. Lindtner, 2020), against which we also want to mention the early stages when they were simply \u2018liminal\u2019. By \u2018liminal\u2019, we define projects that preserve the ambiguities and dichotomies between individualism and collectivism, local and global interests, nationalism and cosmopolitanism. Before serving the nationalist agenda, they were precedents that never became an actual infrastructure, but preserved the value of agency and open future as expressions of Kairos.\",\n            \"summary\": \"The informal prototypes and networks, termed 'geek diplomacy', were eventually utilized by governments for nationalist agendas.
