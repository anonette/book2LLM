Shortly after the Fukushima disaster, many geeks living in Japan envisioned an independent tool for measuring radiation and initiated a global hackerspace response to the crisis. The result was a crowd-sourced DIY kit manufactured in Shenzhen that later developed into a non-profit organization that improved industry standards in radiation monitoring and worked closely with an established company in this domain, International Medcom Inc. \\n   Over a period of two years, the initial ad hoc network of radiation monitoring geeks and volunteers transformed into a global organization supporting open measurements and publication of various atmospheric data.\",\n   \"summary\": \"Safecast began as a DIY radiation monitoring kit in response to the Fukushima disaster. It evolved into a non-profit organization improving industry standards in radiation monitoring, in collaboration with International Medcom Inc.\",\n   \"questions\": [\"What is Safecast and how was it started?\", \"What was the purpose behind the creation of Safecast?\", \"How did Safecast progress and evolve over two years?\"]\n  },\n  {\"text\": \"While the original prototypes supported efforts for independent measurement and data through custom-built DIY tools, subsequent discussions about accuracy and calibration led to a collaboration with regulatory bodies and industry players. Safecast became a pioneering example of \u2018humanitarian\u2019 hardware (Akiba, 2011) that demonstrates the hybrid and liminal possibilities of an emerging public engaged in technology and governance. \\n   From a community-sourced project to a Medcom product, the kit explored a productive tension between open source aspirations and patented technologies. It offers a counter example to the misuses and scandals of the MakerBot 3-D printer discussed by Lindtner (S. M. Lindtner, 2020) as a cautionary story of a coopted and patented open-source prototype that destroyed the community aspirations and ideals.\",\n   \"summary\": \"Safecast's original DIY prototypes led to collaborations with regulatory bodies and industry players. The project evolved from a community-sourced initiative into a product by Medcom, successfully balancing open-source aspirations and patented technologies.\",\n   \"questions\": [\"How did Safecast evolve from a DIY tool to a collaborative product?\", \"What challenges did Safecast face in combining open source and patented technologies?\", \"How did Safecast avoid the pitfalls of the MakerBot 3-D printer incident?\"]\n  },\n  {\"text\": \"The example of Safecast shows how the ambiguity and even liminality of prototyping strengthen rather than weakens the personal and social agency invested in similar open-source projects. Safecast started as a prototype, which was developed into a kit that involves citizens through crowdfunding and workshops, in which citizens learned how to use the tool and calibrate it.\u00a0 The kit gradually transformed into a product that improves quality while complying with industry standards and preserving its connection to the original maker community. This DIY Geiger counter throughout the prototyping, testing, and re-iterating cycle enabled citizens to gather and share independent data on radiation and take an active part in discussing policies related to the future of nuclear energy (Kera et al., 2013).\",\n   \"summary\": \"The Safecast experience demonstrates that prototyping's ambiguity can strengthen user involvement in open-source projects. The project evolved from a prototype to an industry-standard product, maintaining its connection with the original maker community and enabling citizens to contribute to nuclear energy policy discussions.\",\n   \"questions\": [\"How did Safecast maintain its connection with the original maker community?\", \"How did the Safecast project involve citizens in its development?\", \"What impact did Safecast have on discussions about nuclear energy policies?\"]\n  },\n  {\"text\": \"The moment that shows the strength of this liminal and hybrid prototyping is when Safecast integrated a patented technology into its open-source kit. Instead of patenting the open-source design as MakerBot or refusing to engage with the industry, Safecats created a better tool that serves both the geek community and industry. In the process, both sides had to question their ideological biases and insistences on patents or open-source ideals and define a more hybrid and open future. The tool crossed ideological, economic, and other barriers and divides in a way that Zilsel described it in the case of Renaissance instruments. Collaboration with a \u2018friendly\u2019 patent owner benefited both sides without compromising on their original goals of democratizing technology and its repurposing. In Chapter 4 we will describe this hands-on engagement with prototypes as activity supporting what we call experimental policy and \u2018regulation through disonancne\u2019. \\n   The final bGeigieNano Geiger counter was developed by the famous maker who organized tours in Shenzhen, Bunnie Huang, who was always active in the open source hardware community. He worked closely with the community around Safecast and used a patented part from Medcom (the iRover high voltage supply with \u2018front end\u2019, which processes signal from the Geiger tube) (B. Huang, 2012). Although it was produced and distributed by Medcom, the world leader in radiation monitoring, the tool remained a DIY open hardware kit. This hybrid of open source and patented technology did what seizing an opportunity as Kairos means in terms of governance and technology. It means moving beyond the common divisions between open source and patented ideologies, technologies, and even sites, such as hackerspaces and industry, West and Shenzhen. It means to create complex and resilient networks that use both technology and governance for new goals.\",\n   \"summary\": \"Safecast's strength lies in its ability to blend patented technologies with open-source design, serving both the geek community and industry. The final product, an open-source Geiger counter, embodies this hybrid approach, showcasing a move beyond ideological divisions and creating resilient networks for new objectives.\",\n   \"questions\": [\"How did Safecast integrate patented technology into its open-source kit?\", \"Who developed the final bGeigieNano Geiger counter and how did this person contribute to the project?\", \"What does the success of Safecast suggest about the relationship between open-source and patented technologies?\"]\n  },\n  {\"text\": \"Although hardware innovation in Shenzhen will always include exploitative \u2018happiness labor\u2019 and cynical Marxist pitches, brilliantly described by Lindtner, it is also a complex and experimental geopolitical site for experiments that illustrate the importance of Kairos. Technological and political empowerment through prototyping is not fulfilling any socialist, communist, or neoliberal dreams, but performing the temporality of our engagement with prototypes and time. It is not about creating an idealized \u2018imagined community\u2019 beyond history and politics, nor about ideal technology and automation. The prototype tactically explored a variety of networks, concepts, political and economic regimes, and agendas to empower very concrete communities, individuals, and projects, such as the final Geiger counter and its idea of decentralized environmental monitoring over similar tools.\",\n   \"summary\": \"While hardware innovation can involve exploitative practices, it also offers opportunities for complex, experimental endeavors.
