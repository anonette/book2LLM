To \u2018control\u2019 the future means, on the one hand, new prototypes and predictions (monopoly). On the other hand, it means to care and create unexpected insights and visions about society like an artist or a connoisseur. Instead of a monopoly that rules over all, caring about the future is more like a banquet and symposium with friends, an authentic experience of friendship and a search for the common good.\",\n\"summary\": \"The author discusses the role of 'future makers' who balance knowledge and action, and suggests that rather than controlling the future through monopoly, it's about creating new insights and caring for society.\",\n\"questions\": [\"What does the author mean by 'controlling' the future?\", \"How does the author view the role of an artist or a connoisseur in shaping the future?\", \"How does the author contrast the idea of a monopoly with a banquet and symposium with friends?\"]},\n\n{\"title\": \"Dichotomies of Time\",\n\"paragraph\": \"The dichotomies of time as control and care (including connoisseurship and creation), Chronos and Kairos, monopoly and banquet, can help us explain the origins of the myth of automation. Its origins include the problem of prototyping, discovery, and creation of something new, a care for something that no one has cared about before. We argue that prototyping is a practice that either controls the future and closes it off to prediction or liberates the future as something public and open that embraces our agency as such radical for what might exist.\",\n\"summary\": \"The author explores the dichotomies of time, such as control and care, and how these can explain the origins of automation. They argue that prototyping can either control or liberate the future.\",\n\"questions\": [\"What does the author mean by the 'myth of automation'?\", \"How does prototyping relate to controlling or liberating the future?\", \"What is the difference between Chronos and Kairos in terms of time?\"]},\n\n{\"title\": \"Thales' Anecdotes\",\n\"paragraph\": \"Thales' anecdotes define the origins of Western philosophy as the problem of future and time control through science and technology. While Aristotle's version described the first monopoly tool that \u2018privatized\u2019 the future and time, leading to today's algorithmic rule, Plato's account introduced the concept of the future as care for governance and lawmaking. In Plato, Thales is neither a prophet nor an entrepreneur, but a philosopher and free citizen concerned with the future, which is described as a banquet or art.\",\n\"summary\": \"The author draws from Thales' anecdotes to discuss the origins of Western philosophy and the concept of controlling future and time. They compare Aristotle's and Plato's accounts of Thales' philosophy.\",\n\"questions\": [\"How did Aristotle and Plato's versions of Thales' philosophy differ?\", \"What does Thales' philosophy say about the future and time?\", \"How does Plato's account of Thales relate to concepts of governance and lawmaking?\"]},\n\n{\"title\": \"Governing and Control\",\n\"paragraph\": \"Governing as a problem of control over the future in Aristotle and Plato's anecdotes remains a challenge. Although the future under the rule of Chronos is defined by ontological and cosmological commitments in politics, as a matter of Kairos, it becomes a medium of political agency. In both cases, Thales remains the ultimate lawmaker and \u2018modeler\u2019, insisting that his power over his time (Kairos) is as important as his knowledge of time and the \u2018big\u2019 cosmological data (Chronos). While his monopoly tool over olive presses strengthened the existing power structures in society, his critique challenged the ideal of a society, in which olive presses become the only value.\",\n\"summary\": \"The author discusses the challenges of governance as a problem of control over the future, drawing from Aristotle and Plato's anecdotes. They highlight Thales' role and his views on Chronos and Kairos.\",\n\"questions\": [\"What does it mean to govern as a problem of control over the future?\", \"How does Thales' perspective on time relate to governance?\", \"What is the significance of olive presses in Thales' philosophy?\"]},\n\n{\"title\": \"Algorithmic Rule\",\n\"paragraph\": \"Thales' monopoly over olive presses predicts the possibility of algorithmic rule as a control over time, reducing politics to the ontology of patterns and data. However, the same insight into Chronos also challenges the logic of the quick fixes that define the future as an advantage and possible monopoly. In Plato, Thales defines the authentic experience of the future as an issue of good governance beyond the \u2018advantageous\u2019 monopoly: \u2018If he had not made his pupils believe that neither a prophet nor anyone else could judge better than himself what the future to be and seem\u2026 Both and the advantageous are concerned with the future, and everyone would agree that a state in making laws must often fail to attain the greatest advantage?\u2019 (179a)\",\n\"summary\": \"The author explores Thales' monopoly over olive presses as a prediction of algorithmic rule, but also highlights how Thales challenges this concept of the future and argues for good governance beyond monopolies.\",\n\"questions\": [\"How does Thales' monopoly over olive presses relate to algorithmic rule?\", \"What is Thales' argument against defining the future as an advantage and possible monopoly?\", \"How does Thales define good governance?\"]},\n\n{\"title\": \"Governance and Time\",\n\"paragraph\": \"The origin story of Western philosophy thus predicted politics as automation and algorithmic rule, but it is also a story of stargazing, agency, and the freedom to explore and question everything. Since Thales' monopoly contraption and his famous fall, knowledge of time as Chronos challenges our agency over time as Kairos. On the one hand, knowledge of time reduces the experience of opportunity (Kairos) to disruption and innovation, to knowledge that privatizes the control over the future through various monopolies, computer clocks and algorithms, the modern-day olive presses, and governance machines. On the other hand, time as Kairos remains an opportunity to prototype and decide how to apply the knowledge to society. By using discovery and innovation to criticize and transform society, as Thales did in Plato's anecdote, we can explore the future beyond the promises of a monopoly.\",\n\"summary\": \"The author discusses the origin story of Western philosophy, highlighting Thales' monopoly contraption and the impact it has on our understanding of time. They argue that while knowledge of time can lead to monopolies, it can also offer opportunities for discovery and innovation.\",\n\"questions\": [\"How does the author view the impact of Thales' monopoly contraption on our understanding of time?\", \"What does the author mean by 'time as Kairos'?\", \"How does the author suggest we can explore the future beyond monopolies?\"]},\n\n{\"title\": \"Hungry Parasites\",\n\"paragraph\": \"While Thales' anecdotes discuss the cosmological cycles that govern society, the next fragment identifies an actual instrument of time and society control, the sundial. It is a fragment of a Roman playwright attributed to Plautus and quoted in Aulus Gellius (c. 125 - after 180 AD) Latin \u2018commonplace\u2019 book Attic Nights, which consists of encyclopedic entries about famous authors and their tropes (Ibid.). The quote begins with a curse on Palamedes, the mythical inventor of the sundial in Athens, and ends with laments about a city full of sundials that turned its citizens into \u2018hungry parasites\u2019.\",\n\"summary\": \"The author shifts focus to discuss the sundial as an instrument of time and society control, referencing a fragment from a Roman playwright. They highlight the impact of sundials on society, turning citizens into 'hungry parasites'.\",\n\"questions\": [\"What is the significance of the sundial in this context?\", \"Who was Palamedes and what was his connection to the sundial?\", \"What does the author mean by citizens becoming 'hungry parasites'?\"]}"
