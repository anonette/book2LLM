They insisted on a process, or what we call here Kairos, an opportunity to decide and experience agency and decision-making. The infrastructure and regulations in the village remained open to future interpretation and interventions through the historical and contextual processes of political and stakeholder deliberation and participation rather than being hard coded or over-regulated by experts. The playful interaction between participants in the sandbox model offered an ideal environment for designing and deciding together upon the future by combining different tools (natural language, regulations, and code) without prioritizing any regulatory force or domain (market, culture, technology, or law). \",\n\"summary\": \"The participants emphasized the importance of having flexibility in the future of blockchain services, advocating for a process of decision-making rather than hardcoding principles into law or software.

The first is to support experience and negotiation of common future during the prototyping process, which means understanding what different changes in the code and design decisions mean in terms of values and impacts. The second is to prevent the monopolization of the future by one set of interests and values. In contrast to governance by ritual and machine, which leads to a teleology of progress (Chapter 2), governance over sandboxes supports temporary and even plural futures for diverse communities (Chapter 3). Such temporary, hybrid, and even liminal governance emphasizes the experience of Kairos, agency, and capacity for transformation, and even dissent.\",\n\"summary\": \"The sandbox serves two main functions: supporting negotiation of the future during prototyping and preventing any monopolization of the future.

In the sandbox, stakeholders interact without a final and unified theory, insight, or policy goal that claims to save or doom humanity. They combine code with regulations and values in a pragmatic and iterative way that allows everyone to voice their expectations and concerns as they work together to find provisional solutions. While responding to challenges in this ad hoc way (opportunity as Kairos), participants agree on \\\"good enough\\\" solutions without insisting on an ideal and final technological intervention or strong regulation. This is why we describe the process as \\\"regulation through dissonance,\\\" where dissonance is a necessary condition for the need to regulate at all, to make decisions and reach temporary agreements on how best to proceed until the next iteration. It is an autotelic, even agonistic process that brings the experience of time as Kairos, an opportunity for action without guarantees, to the forefront of governance and technology.\",\n\"summary\": \"Exploratory sandboxes allow for future to be collectively negotiated and prototyped.

To test this approach, we created an imaginary smart village \\\"Lithopy\\\" and introduced a biased service (smart contract on a blockchain) to confront the villagers, our workshop participants, with the need to make decisions related to both governance and technology.  The workshop participants would first become villagers by registering their imaginary name, property, and even partnerships on the proof-of-concept blockchain service we designed on Hyperledger Fabric in a way that allows the use of open satellite data from Sentinel 2A and B EU services.\",\n\"summary\": \"The governance of technology also begins with a contact language in a sandbox, where participants can experience the translation of code into regulations.

In the process, they learned about the four domains of regulation (market, culture, technology, and governance), which were presented as different tools and options.\",\n\"summary\": \"Once the 'Lithopy' villagers understood the different layers of technology and regulatory tools, they made decisions about the way forward.
