We will reproduce and formalize this model in the proposal for public and exploratory sandboxes in Chapter 4. Instead of enforcing the status quo of every new infrastructure, dividing society into early adopters (developers and investors) and users or parasites, prototyping in the sandboxes is a struggle to define a common and public good. It is an ongoing experiment and the struggle to preserve time as an open and shared resource that can serve various normative ideals that we can embed in the infrastructures for governance.\",\n      \"summary\": \"This paragraph discusses how current hackerspaces offer a model for prototyping that encourages improvisation and serves various needs.

To democratize future-making in the sandboxes, we have to insist on engaging the citizens in their futures as a matter of Kairos, an opportunity to change rather than obey predefined structures and commands. In the age of prototypes, citizens are participants and stakeholders in their future, rather than mere users of future infrastructures.\",\n      \"summary\": \"In this paragraph, the author stresses the need to consider 'time as Kairos' in governance to ensure social and personal agency over the future.

Thales, according to one of the anecdotes, became a millionaire who turned his knowledge of astronomy and meteorology into a prediction of olive harvest.
