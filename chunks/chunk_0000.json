It is a fantasy of time control and automation that work as a deus ex machina or devil's bridge, offering miracles that turn into curses. Examples go back to the 'predictive analytics' with olive presses in the 6th century BCE, the complaints about the merciless water clock in the 4th century BCE, and Plautus' famous curse of the sundial (Chapter 2). These classic loci show how the fantasies of automation and control over time quickly turn into anxieties about bias, precarity, loss of agency, and sovereignty.\",\n      \"summary\": \"The paragraph discusses the concept of automation through history, noting how it's often seen as both a miraculous solution and a potential curse. This dual nature leads to anxieties concerning bias, loss of control, and sovereignty.\",\n      \"questions\": [\n        \"What is the historical perspective on automation?\",\n        \"How has the perception of automation changed over time?\",\n        \"What are some common concerns related to automation?\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"The reflections on algorithmic governance provide some guidance, but they often focus on the regulation and ownership of the algorithms and data responsible for the automation (Micheli et al. 2020; Elkin-Koren 2020; Saurwein, Just and Latzer 2015; Larsson 2018; Shorey and Howard 2016). Research on algorithmic governance often discusses broad epistemological questions of objectivity and accuracy, including the social, political, and economic implications of algorithms and data in critical data studies (Boyd and Crawford 2012; Ananny and Crawford 2018; Kitchin 2017), even issues of energy and mineral consumption (Crawford 2013; Parikka 2015). These insights will inform our critique, but the focus will remain on uses of the future and time as conditions of automation. We define automation as the control of time through rituals and prototypes of machines and infrastructures that close the future by imposing some type of teleology with universal and final goals.\",\n      \"summary\": \"This paragraph examines the focus of research on algorithmic governance, including regulation and ownership of algorithms and data, and their social, political, and economic implications.

We have extended his central question \\\"Who owns time?\\\" (Zielinski 2006) into a challenge: How can we make time a public resource that involves citizens in shaping the future and allows them to experience their agency? Rather than examining the forgotten and neglected futures of the past, we will focus on the dominant instruments of time and future control described in Chapter 2 as governance machines. While, as governance machines, prototypes reduce governance to automation, as exploratory tools, they have the potential to support public engagement and represent public interests. The prototypes then become a form of social action through which we can experience our personal and collective power over the future and time.\",\n      \"summary\": \"This paragraph discusses the concept of time in relation to prototyping and automation, raising the question of who owns time and how it can be made a public resource.

Before instruments or algorithms become infrastructures owned and regulated by anyone, they are prototypes and explorations that express conflicting ideas, values, and visions for society. At this early, ambiguous, and experimental stage, we need to increase participation and redefine representation. Rather than merely aligning and embedding values and political goals, or propagating technological futures and educating the public about hegemonic infrastructures, the liminal environments of hackerspaces and sandboxes support direct public participation and agency.\",\n      \"summary\": \"The paragraph proposes the concept of 'exploratory sandboxes' to study prototypes that promote agency over the future. It suggests that instruments and algorithms start as prototypes, representing conflicting ideas and visions for society.
