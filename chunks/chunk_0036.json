For hackers and makers, the practices with instruments are close to everyday actions, interests, and aspirations, where they are directly and personally responsible to other humans and institutions. The prototypes transform anonymous scientific labour in laboratories characterized by strict adherence to bioethical and biosafety protocols into \u2018artisan science\u2019 work (Ibid..), but also \u2018actions\u2019 with political, artistic, and other consequences.  They challenge the governance models and funding of research, explore the future of blockchain technologies, or play with bioelectronix. The OpenDrop enables citizens to directly experience and manipulate some aspect of nature (hydrophobic surfaces, electrocapillary forces, interactions between molecules or organisms) and discuss with their peers the ethical dilemmas, political goals, or some other aspects of such action. What defines prototypes and artisan science are exactly these uses that go beyond the common laboratory work and labor. They form genuine civic actions, but also private explorations and creative misuses.\", \n    \"summary\": \"The freedom and ability for hackers and makers to create and experiment with prototypes and instruments can lead to many outcomes such as political actions, artistic consequences, or even exploration of the future of blockchain technologies.

It was clear to me that there is a need for easily accessible hardware in this technology. Although it has been around for almost 20 years, the interest in this kind of lab automation seems to be big and open devices are not available. The patent situation is quite difficult as there seem to be many patents and the most important probably with Illumina, which also released its first commercial product about a year ago... So for me the project was also interesting in terms of \u2018institution hacking\u2019 - before we tried to convince traditional research laboratories to work with us and use our network and skills in a fast prototype, and they never took us too seriously, as you know. Now all of a sudden, we were contacted by them, and they were eager to collaborate and even started sharing information on their research project more openly. I think we should do more of these hackteria network projects, like now also the gyne-punk and open estrogen. We even got contacted by Head Technology Assessment and Chief Technology Office at Roche Diagnostics; he was surprised to see a new development coming out of nowhere and having connections to institutions like Wheeler Lab or MIT.\u2019 (U. Gaudenz, personal communication, 5 July 2016).\",\n    \"summary\": \"Urs Gaudens, the developer of OpenDrop, discusses the various uses of prototypes and the need for easily accessible hardware.

What Urs Gaudenz describes as \u2018institutional hacks\u2019 and \u2018network projects\u2019 challenge this \u2018big science\u2019 (Price, 1986) power dynamics and status quo (Price, 1986). They show how the work on the instruments can directly support social and political agendas defined by the participants of the workshops and even lead to new organizations and initiatives. Prototyping in this sense becomes a means of Kairos in governance as much as technology that opens the future and democratizes the control.
