Time as a linear, measurable, and external entity, or Chronos, is a mathematical abstraction defined by patterns and cycles in nature or society. As Kairos, it expresses opportunity- the personal and social agency and actions of people. Chronos is an abstract structure that eludes any personal or social action; it is a langue rather than an individual parole (Sanders 2004), a strategy (institutions, power structures) rather than a tactic (individual use, adoption, or appropriation (Certeau 1984).\",\n     \"summary\": \"The authors use the concept of Chronos and Kairos to explain how time became a tool for control.

Rather than outsourcing every decision to ontology or cosmology, prototyping for governance becomes a matter of Kairos. It is synonymous with taking responsibility for the future, risking, even failing, but making choices as individuals and communities without outsourcing them to cosmological forces. While time as Chronos results in systems and models imposed upon society claiming a superior knowledge of cycles and phenomena outside the history and lives of the citizens, as Kairos time supports personal and social agency and what Paul W. Kahn discusses in his origins of the legal order as a \u2018project\u2019 (Kahn 2019) \u2013 political and social commitment, stakes in the future.\",\n     \"summary\": \"Kairos is seen as practices that use time as a public good, a medium of active political life that includes innovation and discovery.
