They combined open technology standards with emancipatory, political, and aesthetic agendas, even philosophical and metaphysical concerns (estrogen cult, unity of life, apocalyptic future, transgender dystopia) and produced hybrids and provocations. On the one hand, the prototypes supported cheaper and better tools for managing insulin or estrogen in our bodies and the environment (biosensors to monitor water pollution or insulin levels). On the other hand, prototypes became critical and emancipatory tools that question the decisions and management of hormones in our bodies, society, and nature. They became means of rethinking access to insulin and estrogen, extraction and synthesis of hormones, individual and collective responsibilities, and risks. They opened the philosophical and ontological questions about molecules creating politics.\"],\n \"summary\": \"The text discusses new prototypes in hormone hacking projects that create new connections between various fields such as nature, culture, and politics. These prototypes are significant as they not only provide improved tools for managing hormones but also bring into question the decisions and management of hormones in our bodies, society, and nature.\",\n \"questions\": [\"What are the objectives of the hormone hacking projects?\", \"What role do the prototypes play in these projects?\", \"How have these prototypes influenced the management of hormones in our bodies, society, and nature?\"]}\n\n{\"title\": \"Prototypes and public participation in science\",\n \"paragraphs\": [\"The prototypes in these projects help citizens to research natural phenomena and also probe social and political processes beyond science as means of negotiating decisions in controversies. They engaged the public with Chronos as new knowledge, and Kairos as action in both technology and governance. Practical work on the prototypes intricately connected future making to defining alternative scenarios experienced in the workshops. Although prototypes enabled more people to do science, they also defined new forms of public participation and material engagements with science, where the pursuit of knowledge supports the deliberation and creative explorations. This opened the future to public imagination and curiosity, which became material, conceptual, but also political practice with an open future.\"],\n \"summary\": \"The author discusses how prototypes in projects help citizens in researching natural phenomena and examining social and political processes beyond just science. These prototypes have also allowed for the public to engage with new knowledge and actions in both technology and governance, thus fostering public participation in science.\",\n \"questions\": [\"How do prototypes help citizens engage with science?\", \"What role do prototypes play in the public's involvement in science?\", \"How does the use of prototypes impact future-making?\"]}\n\n{\"title\": \"Prototypes bridging divides\",\n \"paragraphs\": [\"Philosophy, religion, politics, and business have influenced the development of science instruments since the 16th century. They transformed the instruments into infrastructures and governance machines that include science institutions that define the goal of governance as automation and control. The instruments control time as Chronos by reducing various phenomena to patterns and cycles (Sections 2.3. and 2.4, 3.1). They define the future as a matter of Instauratio, a teleological project of restoration of the human power over nature as promised by God.\"],\n \"summary\": \"The text discusses how various fields such as philosophy, religion, politics, and business have influenced the development of science instruments since the 16th century.

They bring science closer to public life, but also private explorations discussed here via the dichotomy of vita activa and otium (Arendt 2013), emancipatory and exploratory uses of instruments.
