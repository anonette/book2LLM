It is described as an institution that explores variety of interactions between nature and society without teleology and hierarchy where the \u2018smallest particle of matte is a world of creatures, living beings, animals, entelechies, souls\u2019 (Lebniz, Gottfried Wilhelm, 1898). This garden or pond of recursive gardens explores the relationships between different actors, without closing the future to one project, instrument, or monopoly. In this \\\"strange thought\\\" describing the future academy, Leibniz does not even attempt to reconcile his wild ontology and vitalism with teleology (as he does in the last passages of his monadology).\",\n\"summary\": \"Leibniz's 'odd thought' described an institution (the Academy of Sciences) which functioned as a model for holistic engagement, exploring a variety of interactions between nature and society without imposing a hierarchy. The institution, akin to a pond full of recursive gardens, allowed for a continuous fostering of relationships between different entities, avoiding a future monopolized by a single project or instrument.\",\n\"questions\": [\"What is the significance of the 'odd thought' that Leibniz presents in his essay?\", \"Why is the concept of a 'recursive garden' important in understanding the role of the Academy of Sciences?\", \"How does Leibniz's vision deviate from the conventional understanding of teleology?\"]\n},\n{\n\"paragraph\": \"While Francis Bacon's Instauratio reduced politics to ontology and cosmology that supports the rule of patrons over the future, Lebniz\u2019s academy, like other artisan prototypes, democratizes the future and opens it to hybrid and open engagements. Artisans like Thales, Drebbel or Leibniz revived the value of time as Kairos as essential for science, technology, and governance. Their open-ended, plural, and artisanal explorations offer an alternative to Instauratio and emphasize personal and social agency above the structures in technology and governance.\",\n\"summary\": \"Unlike Francis Bacon's Instauratio which was a reduction of politics to ontology and cosmology to support the rule of patrons, Leibniz's academy democratized the future and adopted a more open approach. Artisans such as Thales, Drebbel and Leibniz revived the concept of 'Kairos', valuing the timeliness and appropriateness of actions in science, technology and governance.\",\n\"questions\": [\"How does Leibniz's academy differ from Francis Bacon's Instauratio?\", \"Why is the concept of 'Kairos' important in the context of science, technology, and governance?\", \"What role do artisans play in the democratization of the future?\"]\n},\n{\n\"paragraph\": \"From Giorgio Agamben's discussions of the paradigm and Middle Ages' exempla and regula (Agamben, 2009a) to Vera Keller's Renaissance cosmoscopes, living machines, and desiderata (Keller, 2010, 2013, 2015) or Leibniz's academy, prototypes describe hybrid, political, and ontological experiments. They combine Chronos with Kairos to support imaginative and open futures of science, technology, and governance.  With this idiosyncratic genealogy of automation as one of many goals of prototyping, we hope to outline the possibility of experiments with governance over prototypes. Instead of closing the future to one project of Instauratio or progress, prototypes explore alternatives to automation or the absolute rule of Chronos and its governance machines. They explore a future as a monad that mirrors the various ontological and political engagements and commitments on macro, meso, and micro scales.\",\n\"summary\": \"Prototypes, as discussed by Agamben, Keller, and Leibniz, are hybrid, political, and ontological experiments that combine Chronos (time as a quantity) and Kairos (time as a quality) to support an imaginative future of science, technology, and governance. This unconventional genealogy of automation provides a platform for experimenting with governance over prototypes, as they do not limit the future to a specific project or the absolute rule of Chronos.\",\n\"questions\": [\"What role do prototypes play in shaping the future of science, technology, and governance?\", \"How do prototypes combine Chronos and Kairos?\", \"Why is an unconventional genealogy of automation important?\"]\n},\n{\n\"paragraph\": \"Renaissance artisans and present hackers and makers are the true heirs of Thales. They engage with prototypes to express their agency and visions for the future as open and public, questioning the rule of patrons or gods. From the forgotten practices of instrument making in the Renaissance period (Chapter 2) to present liminal practices in the hackerspaces (Chapter 3) and future sandboxes (Chapter 4), prototypes support the experience of agency and Kairos in governance and technology. In the next chapters, we will discuss examples of prototyping in the hackerspaces and liminal environments to explain how they support open future and time as a matter of personal and social agency against the myth of automation.\",\n\"summary\": \"Renaissance artisans and current hackers and makers continue Thales' legacy by using prototypes to express their agency and vision for open, public futures. These practices challenge traditional power dynamics, and through the use of prototypes, they promote agency and emphasis on Kairos in governance and technology.

The \u2018autotelic\u2019 role of prototypes in governance that we will explore in the next chapter does not reduce governance to technological innovation, disruption, automation, or infrastructure. Against the rule governance machines, it supports Kairos in governance over various liminal environments that will serve as a model for the proposed exploratory sandboxes in Chapter 4.\",\n\"summary\": \"Prototyping serves dual purposes: it creates new instruments and infrastructures that may limit the future to a single goal, but also expresses the future as an open and autotelic activity.
