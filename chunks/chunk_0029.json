Rather than supporting governance based on algorithms, code, or promissory infrastructures, liminal practices and spaces support personal and social engagements with science and technology. We will use examples of open science hardware instruments in Section 3.1 and the open hardware innovation ecosystem in Shenzhen in Section 3.2 to demonstrate interventions that preserve the experience of time as Kairos. They also support our findings from the forgotten history of instrument making and prototyping (Sections 2.3 and 2.4), which inform our proposal for exploratory sandboxes in Chapter 4.\",\n     \"summary\": \"The concept of future-making and prototyping integrates Kairos, the personal and opportune moment, into science and technology governance. This approach advocates for the democratization of these fields and relies on personal and social interactions rather than algorithms and infrastructures.

Instead of a predictive control, his monopoly contraption served as a critique of the status quo and the values of society. Thales\u2019 knowledge of cycles and Chronos performed the importance of his personal time as Kairos. His goal was to demonstrate the value of personal time to conduct research and formulate insights that challenge values and power structures in society (Sections 2.0 and 2.1). He used the knowledge of Chronos (measurable orbits, patterns, and cycles) to express his agency as Kairos in politics and science and technology.\",\n     \"summary\": \"Modern scientific instruments aim to replicate Thales' success without considering his original intentions.

Through technological innovation and disruption, prototypes change society, but they also explore radical ideas about governance. Instead of reducing Kairos to innovation, prototypes also embrace the freedom to experiment and engage with open future as an equally important expression of agency, as we will show in the present grassroots movements of makerspaces, hackerspace, and citizen laboratories that experiment with governance and technology.\",\n     \"summary\": \"The concept of prototyping serving Kairos can be traced back to Thales and the Renaissance period.
