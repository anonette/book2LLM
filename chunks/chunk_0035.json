That night in a cafe Rudi and Mirela were already sketching first prototypes on a napkin... Then we went to Helsinki for a group teaching to PIa's student. That is when we sort of sneaked into a lab where DropBot was in use... Then in spring I brought some Italians to GaudiLabs and we did the hack/coating/art sprint... So much fun. Then I organized the biocommons meeting in the south of Italy at RuralHub, where interest around this tech raised from many different parties.

It created an informal network closer to the Renaissance networks of friends than an institutionalized science. It was a direct result of serendipitous and creative encounters with microfludics in the Hackteria network with a long history and various goals described by Urs Gaudenz, its main hardware developer: \u2018R\u00fcdiger and I were talking about the idea of a compact integrated desktop biolab for many years. We wanted the device to be able to do oligo synthesis, different bio assays, PCR, spectrometry, just all the synbio and crazy stuff, more like a long-term vision...
