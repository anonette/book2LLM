Instead, they mobilize participants to create something new in terms of technology, governance, and regulation. In this sense, they use prototypes as autotelic catalysts that induce new experiences. Transistors, computers, and programming languages do not exist prior to their conceptualization. This conceptualization does not consist of new knowledge of old reality, but of a new reality seeking a conceptual framework within which to situate itself. (Ibid.) In this sense, the prototypes in the sandboxes are generative experiences of time as kairos, rather than descriptions of a pre-existing ontology leading to discovery, technology, or the rule of time as chronos. We discussed these autotelic and generative functions of prototypes in the chapter on making futures through paradigms and living instruments (Section 2.3), extended to issues of governance.\",\n\"summary\": \"Metaphors and sandboxes are tools that encourage new creations in technology, governance, and regulation.

This concept of liminal environments supporting ad hoc interactions and the construction of a common goal explains the purpose of an exploratory sandbox: It shows that not only discovery and innovation, but also regulation occur 'through dissonance' (Section 4.1). Sandboxes, metaphors, and complex allegories never describe or reproduce something that already exists, but stimulate new connections and communication between different actors and groups to create 'contact' rather than a common language, and to stimulate change through collaboration rather than unity. Such environments foster new ways of seeing and imagining both technology and governance, algorithms, and decision-making. The hybrid and agonistic processes in the sandbox as a 'trading zone' define prototyping as future making, a liminal experience that preserves the tensions between what exists and what might exist, as discussed in Section 2.3.\",\n\"summary\": \"The concept of 'trading zones', liminal environments that foster ad hoc interactions and the development of common goals, helps explain how prototypes can be operationalized as generative metaphors in sandboxes.

They embody a new way of understanding the relationship between technology and society that preserves the value of open futures and agency over time, as both kairos and chronos. The exploratory and public sandboxes only amplify the effect of a good metaphor in computing, emphasizing agency as an experience of kairos in both governance and technology. Like hybrid and liminal environments, sandboxes support experimentation with technology and governance while preventing any reduction or closure of the future. They make the encounters between agency and structure, algorithms, and regulations an effect of the history, deliberation, and social interaction that remain open to kairos.\",\n\"summary\": \"Algorithms and infrastructures developed from metaphors or exploratory sandboxes offer a fresh perspective on the relationship between technology and society, emphasizing the importance of open futures and agency.
