The experience of engaging with instruments is about understanding their connection to different everyday activities (Delgrado mentions food hacking projects) rather than the \u2018higher truth\u2019 of patterns and signals resulting in the religious or cosmological communion with Chronos or Instauratio. Instead of serving the myth of automation that \u2018ritualizes\u2019 science and technology through infrastructures closing the opportunities for the individual and communal agency, prototypes allow citizens to imagine and explore different futures for science and society.\",\n      \"summary\": \"Delgrado emphasizes the importance of personal and social agency in the development of DIYbio prototypes.

The aspirational, private, and often contradictory goals of the citizen science public expressed through their instruments are elaborated further by Meyer. He uses L\u00e9vi-Strauss' notion of \u2018bricolage\u2019 along with Ivan Illich's \u2018tools of conviviality\u2019 to capture open processes of making and to use DIY tools  for future-making on the example of OpenPRC or the Open Gel Box (Meyer, 2015).\",\n      \"summary\": \"Delgrado views the DIYbio instruments as expressions of individual aspirations and as a way for people to shape the future.

In our opinion, all prototyping must remain openly agonistic to preserve active vita (vita activa) and agency. The combination of entrepreneurial and community-oriented aspirations forms what Meyer describes as the aspiration for \u2018citizen biotech economies\u2019 (Ibid.), where on one side they foster \u2018material redistribution, democratization and an alternative to established science\u2019 and on the other they feed the neoliberal agenda of start-ups and techno-deterministic illusions. This \u2018promisory equipment\u2019 is caught up in innovation tension between the fetishization and community goals, which Meyer describes as a \u2018convergence between material practices and moral visions, between the redesign of scientific objects and the articulation of political objectives\u2019. (Ibid.)\",\n      \"summary\": \"Mayer suggests that the democratization of science instruments can lead to tensions between communal and commercial goals.
