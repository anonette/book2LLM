It is a myth that reduces politics to cosmology and ontology and imposes the rules of rituals, (timekeeping) instruments (Sections 2.1 and 2.2), and infrastructures serving the patrons. Against the concept of governance as control and automation over patterns and cycles of Chronos, we emphasize the experience of time as Kairos. It defines governance as a problem of personal and social agency that involves radical uncertainty, improvisation, and the negotiation of the future.  In the next sections, we will discuss how Renaissance prototypes of instruments both supported and problematized the ideal of governance as automation, monopoly, and control over the future.\",\n     \"summary\": \"The text discusses the concept of governance using algorithms, models, and decentralized ledgers which essentially reenacts the myth of automation.

On the one hand, prototypes of Renaissance instruments affirmed the ideal of Thales' monopoly. They become means of the Francis Bacon project of science serving the restoration of a promised order in nature and society (Instauration later described as progress). On the other hand, Renaissance prototypes also echo Thales\u2019 gesture of using knowledge of cosmology and Chronos to challenge society. Such instruments reject the teleological ideal of progress or restoration and emphasize overlooked practices of meaning-making supportive of personal and social agency, discussed here as paradigms, analogies, and models (Agamben, 2009b).\",\n     \"summary\": \"The text examines two notions of governance as it relates to the future. First, it presents the idea of Renaissance prototypes that affirm Thales' concept of monopoly. These prototypes serve the Baconian project of restoring an order in nature and society.
