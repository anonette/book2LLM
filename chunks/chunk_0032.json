It is prototyping that revives the values of artisanal and \u2018maker knowledge\u2019. Instead of serving predefined and teleological goals that reinforce the status quo, the prototypes in the hackerspaces define their own agenda, commitments, and visions of the future. They combine the theoretical, aesthetic, political, and pragmatic interests of the local and global groups of geeks, hackers, and makers to initiate temporary but resilient networks and institutions and combine governance with prototyping.\", \n  \"summary\": \"The practice of prototyping in hackerspaces and makerspaces aims to keep the future open-ended. Rather than adhering to predetermined goals that uphold existing structures, these prototypes set their own objectives, combining a range of interests to form flexible networks and institutions.\", \n  \"questions\": [\"What is the main objective of prototyping in hackerspaces and makerspaces?\", \"How do these prototypes formulate their own agenda?\", \"What interests do these prototypes combine?\"]}, \n\n  {\"text\": \"Between 2010 and 2016, we followed emerging hackerspaces, makerspaces, fablabs, and citizen laboratories in various regions to understand how they use prototypes and experiment with science and technology in (self)governance. Over the years, we documented over twenty projects around the world that capture the role of prototyping in mobilizing different social, political, and aesthetic agendas (Kera, 2012b, 2012c; Kera et al., 2013; Kera, 2014a). The main insight was that many of the prototypes mock and subvert the techno-utopian agendas to create opportunities for personal and communal agency over the future. They combine learning and research with deliberation, artistic, and philosophical reflections.\", \n  \"summary\": \"From 2010 to 2016, the authors tracked various hackerspaces and fablabs to understand their use of prototypes in self-governance.
