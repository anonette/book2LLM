      "The pervasive control of time through algorithms and associated bureaucratic structures, such as standards, further erodes the experience of time as an agency to discover, decide, disrupt, or negotiate the future with others. We will discuss this form of control and the ideal of governance as a myth of automation. To understand where the promise of an ultimate control over the future and time comes from, we will begin with a question. How do matters of public life become rituals and automated services that leave no room for chance, improvisation, but also for agency and action? What are the metaphysical, political, and material conditions under which governance becomes a matter of automation and algorithms? \n",
      "   The reflections on algorithmic governance provide some guidance, but they often focus on the regulation and ownership of the algorithms and data responsible for the automation (Micheli et al. 2020; Elkin-Koren 2020; Saurwein, Just and Latzer 2015; Larsson 2018; Shorey and Howard 2016). Research on algorithmic governance often discusses broad epistemological questions of objectivity and accuracy, including the social, political, and economic implications of algorithms and data in critical data studies (Boyd and Crawford 2012; Ananny and Crawford 2018; Kitchin 2017), even issues of energy and mineral consumption (Crawford 2013; Parikka 2015). These insights will inform our critique, but the focus will remain on uses of the future and time as conditions of automation. We define automation as the control of time through rituals and prototypes of machines and infrastructures that close the future by imposing some type of teleology with universal and final goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " To discuss the problem of automation in governance, we will combine metaphysical questions of time and agency with political questions of power (Chapter 2). What is good governance in an age of prototypes that disrupt and control citizens' public and even private lives, often without clear mandates? How do we ensure that any immense power over the future and time respects any values we hold dear in our institutions and political processes, such as human rights, the rule of law, the values of political pluralism, legitimacy, or accountability?\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "We will discuss these questions by focusing on the relationship between science, technology, and society as a problem of prototyping (Chapters 3 and 4). The dichotomies of agency and structure, or action and knowledge, experiences of time as Chronos and Kairos (timekeeping and timing), will help us understand how prototype defines governance. Rather than prototypes that reduce governance to better automation (Chapter 2), we are interested in prototypes that democratize power over the future and time (Chapters 3 and 4). Prototyping has the potential to open the future to public participation and define political and technological representation as a matter of practice. We will define prototyping that tries to \"save\" time as a public good and reject the myth of automation and disruptive infrastructures as our modern-day devil's bridges (Chapter 4).\n",
      "Genealogy of future making\n",
      "   The discussion of time and the future as a problem of prototyping and automation pays homage to Siegfried Zielinski's project of 'time media' and 'time machines'. We have extended his central question \"Who owns time?\" (Zielinski 2006) into a challenge: How can we make time a public resource that involves citizens in shaping the future and allows them to experience their agency? Rather than examining the forgotten and neglected futures of the past, we will focus on the dominant instruments of time and future control described in Chapter 2 as governance machines. While, as governance machines, prototypes reduce governance to automation, as exploratory tools, they have the potential to support public engagement and represent public interests. The prototypes then become a form of social action through which we can experience our personal and collective power over the future and time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Before science instruments become governance machines embedded in technical standards, market expectations, and other bureaucratic structures (Sections 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2), they are prototypes that support personal and community commitments. Liminal and experimental environments for prototyping in the hackerspaces described in Chapter 3 will offer examples of such engagements with instruments outside the market forces, industry standards, patents, or other power structures. Together with the historical examples or early instruments in Chapter 2, these prototypes will demonstrate the alternatives to governance as automation. In Chapter 4, we will extrapolate these lessons and examples into a proposal for an experimental sandbox that combines prototyping with governance to support personal and social action and agency over the future. \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "The genealogy of automation in Chapter 2 follows Zielinski's revision of media history, but not his goal of resurrecting the âdeadâ and forgotten futures of the past through art and media archaeology. We capture the dynamic of âimagination and calculationâ (Zielinski 2006) as a question of action and structure (knowledge) and focus on how we can democratize future making and prototyping. The early attempts to govern via prototypes (Chapter 2, especially Sections 2.3 and 2.4) will serve as material for our genealogy that aims to âexorciseâ automation from governance (and prototypes) in the rest of Chapters 2 and 3.  \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "We call this process exorcism, because it uses genealogy to identify and defuse the arbitrary exercise of power in promissory infrastructures and new instruments that âpossessâ our private and public lives. By identifying moments of resignation, in relation to politics, agency, and the future, we create an opportunity to rethinking the role of prototyping in governance (Chapters 3 and 4). The alternative history of instrument making from the Renaissance period (Sections 2.3 and 2.4) to today's hackerspaces, makerspaces, and citizen science labs (Chapter 3) illustrates the existence and importance of alternative engagements with instruments and future-making.\n",
      "   To explore prototypes that support agency over the future rather than control, we propose exploratory sandboxes (Chapter 4) that extend the practices identified in the forgotten history of instrument making (Chapter 2) and observed in the liminal spaces (Chapter 3). Before instruments or algorithms become infrastructures owned and regulated by anyone, they are prototypes and explorations that express conflicting ideas, values, and visions for society. At this early, ambiguous, and experimental stage, we need to increase participation and redefine representation. Rather than merely aligning and embedding values and political goals, or propagating technological futures and educating the public about hegemonic infrastructures, the liminal environments of hackerspaces and sandboxes support direct public participation and agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Liminal and exploratory prototyping enables citizens to define their stake in the future and prevent excesses of algorithmic rule and automation. As stakeholders in the future, citizens understand that time is a common good and a public resource that must be cared for. Instead of being mere users of future infrastructures or media archaeologists lamenting the loss of forgotten futures, citizens express their agency and vision through prototypes. They negotiate their future with others without closing it or claiming that one ideal would serve all. \n",
