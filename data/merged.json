It is a fantasy of time control and automation that work as a deus ex machina or devil's bridge, offering miracles that turn into curses. Examples go back to the 'predictive analytics' with olive presses in the 6th century BCE, the complaints about the merciless water clock in the 4th century BCE, and Plautus' famous curse of the sundial (Chapter 2). These classic loci show how the fantasies of automation and control over time quickly turn into anxieties about bias, precarity, loss of agency, and sovereignty.",

Research on algorithmic governance often discusses broad epistemological questions of objectivity and accuracy, including the social, political, and economic implications of algorithms and data in critical data studies (Boyd and Crawford 2012; Ananny and Crawford 2018; Kitchin 2017), even issues of energy and mineral consumption (Crawford 2013; Parikka 2015).

In the process, both sides had to question their ideological biases and insistences on patents or open-source ideals and define a more hybrid and open future. The tool crossed ideological, economic, and other barriers and divides in a way that Zilsel described it in the case of Renaissance instruments. Collaboration with a \u2018friendly\u2019 patent owner benefited both sides without compromising on their original goals of democratizing technology and its repurposing.

            "For Schmitt, it was this idea of a modern state as an artificial and mechanical rather than spiritual unity that enabled all later forms of industrial state to use new technologies as tools of sovereignty. The idea of a state as a technical apparatus, or what we call algorithmic governance, was born with the metaphor of the Leviathan: \u2018The intrinsic logic of the \u2018state\u2019 of a man-made artificial product does not culminate in a person but in a machine. Not the representation by a person, but the factual, current accomplishment of genuine protection is what the state is all about. Representation is nothing if it is not tutela praesens. However, this can only be attained by an effectively functioning command mechanism. The state that came into being in the 17th century and prevailed on the continent of Europe is, in fact, a product of men and differs from all earlier kinds of political units [...]. (Ibid.)",
            "The Hobbesian modern state leads directly to the present algorithmic (or technological) governance. It is the original prototype of absolute and arbitrary power that nothing can resist because everyone will be willing to submit to it: \u2018[T]hat state was created not only an essential intellectual or sociological precondition for the technical-industrial age that followed, but also the typical, even prototypical, work of the new technological era, the development of the state itself.  (Ibid.) Schmitt\u2019s state as a \u2018product of human calculation\u2019 necessarily leads to automation, a technically perfect mechanism that is synonymous with absolute authority that performs its structure: \u2018But the idea of the state as a technically completed, manmade magnum-artificium, a machine that realizes \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018truth\u2019 only in itself\u2014namely, in its performance and function\u2014was first grasped by Hobbes and systematically constructed by him into a clear concept. The connection between the highest degree of technical neutrality and the highest authority is, as a matter of fact, not alien to the ingenious thinkers of the 17th century. At the end of Campanella\u2019s vision of the \u2018Sun State\u2019, there appears a large ship without a rudder and a sail but driven by a mechanism that is commanded and guided by the possessor of \u2018absolute authority\u2019 [...].

Schmitt quotes Ernst J\u00fcnger\u2019s vision of warships as \u2018swimming outposts of enormous power, armored compartments, in which the claim to power is compressed in a narrow space.\u2019 Campanella\u2019s vision of the \u2018Sun state\u2019 becomes literal: \u2018The technically perfect mechanism of a large ship in the hands of an absolute authority who determines its course\u2019.

            "We tested such a gradual process of algorithmic domestication and participation on the example of future services in an imaginary smart village of Lithopy. The format of the workshop enabled participants to understand the technology and influence the design of smart contracts while introducing templates regulations. While exploring how to combine technology with existing institutions, participants tested possible algorithmic sovereignty beyond Leviathan- and Wicker-man-style automation.",

As a functional prototype of services for a community using satellite data to trigger a transaction, it made clear what is at stake in such futures. Citizens, as participants in the workshop, experienced various degrees of automation and regulation to define comfortable levels of personal autonomy and algorithmic governance. It helped them investigate the power of technology while understanding the different possibilities of their agency through regulation to curb the power of algorithms. In this sense, it served the objective of tactical, situated and \u2018participatory\u2019 automation that embeds social and personal agency in algorithm design processes. The sandbox as a trading zone for \u2018regulation through dissonance\u2019 transformed \u2018the logic of binary states, yes and no, into fuzzy states of maybes and maybe\u2019 (Galison, 1997).",
            "The playful and liminal environment supported the use of regulations and codes as tactics that seek ways to resist the structure of algorithmic governance (Certeau, 2011). As an environment for \u2018tactical\u2019 and \u2018situated\u2019 automation that is participatory and liminal, the sandbox involved citizens directly as individuals and an ad hoc group: \u2018These workshops support participation in automation by engaging human participants directly in the creation of technologies that are also strategically used to control their daily practices through the dominant sociotechnical order, but with tactical intention in this sense, these participatory workshops make the actual physical production of the boards, which is tedious part of a community bonding experience that supports peer economy and liberation rather than alienation of labor. \u2018 (Hee-jeong Choi et al., 2020)",
            "The exploratory sandbox thus extends the functions of the liminal environments described in Chapter 3 or the workshops in the hackerspaces described in the article on situated and participatory automation (Ibid.). It enables citizens to directly understand what is at stake in the code and regulation while participating in their tweaking and development. In the case of the Lithopy sandbox, participants used the Hyperledger fabric blockchain as a \u2018testnet\u2019 on a server, where it was possible to check prototypes of smart contracts that use open satellite data (from Sentinel 2A and 2B) for various services and automation. As villagers, they would sign contracts after watching a near-future scenario in a fantasy design fiction movie. They would negotiate interventions and changes after witnessing a discriminatory contract excluding certain nationalities from buying property in the village.",
            "The Lithopy sandbox offered an experience of agency over the code and regulation for a concrete community. It supported the goal of experimental and experimentalist governance as a process of negotiation and consensus building in a power vacuum where individual stakeholders have to define their interests and relations, but also norms and goals on the go (Sabel & Zeitlin, 2012). Although most regulatory sandboxes insist on innovation, the Lithopy sandbox was always a \u2018trade zone\u2019, a productive environment to support coordination and exchanges of knowledge and resources between different and even antagonistic stakeholders.

Instead of supporting the myth and ideal of automation in governance represented by the figures of the Leviathan and Wicker Man, such prototyping is an opportunity for agency, vision, and experiments beyond any universal solution and absolute rule. In this sense, prototyping defines a need for democratizing future-making and realizing that time is Kairos, a public resource and infrastructure for commons preserving the opportunity for our agency.

It is the search for more authentic technology, community, and cosmology over tools in parallel that supports the personal and communal experience of time and agency.

Galison was able to show how successful exchanges between various stakeholders (scientists, but also policymakers and businesses) depended on the importance of preserving their identity and diversity, event potential conflicts. Instead of finding a single unified theory, practice, value or institution, innovation (and we claim also regulation) depends on the plurality and dissent as experiences of Kairos.

Two groups can agree on rules of exchange even if they ascribe utterly different significance to the objects being exchanged; they may even disagree on the meaning of the exchange process itself. Nonetheless, the trading partners can hammer out a local coordination despite vast global differences. In an even more sophisticated way, cultures in interaction frequently establish contact languages, systems of discourse that can vary from the most function-specific jargons, through semispecific pidgins, to full-fledged creoles rich enough to support activities as complex as poetry and metalinguistic reflection.\u2019 (Ibid..)",
